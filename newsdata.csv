https://undark.org/2019/09/25/honeybee-fearsome-enemy-mite/,n,"California’s beekeepers were worried they wouldn’t have enough bees to pollinate the almond bloom, their biggest money-making event of the year. Gene Brandi, a California beekeeper and the former president of the American Beekeeping Federation, said winter losses were “as bad or worse than I believe it’s been.”

It turns out he was right. It was another grim year for America’s beekeepers, already reeling from more than a decade of colony losses that threaten the commercial honeybee industry. An annual survey released in June by the Bee Informed Partnership (BIP), a nonprofit collaboration of leading research labs and universities, found that beekeepers lost 38 percent of their colonies last winter, the highest winter figure since the survey began 13 years ago.

Managed honeybees play a crucial role in the nation’s food production, contributing an estimated $15 billion to the U.S. economy each year by helping to pollinate at least 90 crops.

Virtually everyone in the beekeeping business will tell you that the biggest threat facing honeybees isn’t pesticides, starvation, or even the mysterious affliction known as colony collapse disorder that made big news a dozen years ago. Instead, they’ll blame Varroa destructor, a parasitic Asian mite that snuck into the country more than 30 years ago. When asked to cite the three biggest risks to honeybees, Susan Cobey, a renowned expert on bee breeding at Washington State University, says, “Varroa, Varroa, Varroa.”

So far, the primary defense has been mite-killing pesticides known as miticides, but over time Varroa have developed resistance to some of them, and the beekeepers’ arsenal is diminishing quickly. “We think that Varroa are playing an increasing and very large role in these losses,” says Dennis vanEngelsdorp, a University of Maryland researcher working with the BIP. “In part because the products that are used to control them aren’t working as well, and also the viruses that they transmit are becoming more virulent.”

Even as Varroa continue to put enormous pressure on commercial beekeepers, and researchers work to breed bees that can better fight them off, another dangerous mite has been spreading in parts of Asia. If it arrives on our shores, it could push the beekeeping industry over the edge."
https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/oneplus-phones-score-high-on-performance-and-reliability-in-user-survey-more-users-likely-to-switch-to-it-1604524-2019-09-29,y,"his is something that we often see when we talk to OnePlus users. They tend to love their phones, and rate them high on reliability, performance, quality of software, and even camera. Now, a survey that saw participation of over 15000 users has found that OnePlus users are most satisfied of the lot.
In the survey conducted by 91Mobiles, a tech content website, nearly 80 per cent OnePlus users said that they were satisfied with their phone. This was ahead of even the satisfaction rate among the iPhone users. The iPhone was third best on this count Realme was second with 65 per cent of its users satisfied with their phones as 63 per cent iPhone users said that they were happy with their phone.
The survey finds that currently, Xiaomi is the most popular brand in India, with a market share of 23 per cent, followed by Samsung at 21 per cent. But at the same time, there is something interesting that the survey apparently throws up. It’s about the future. The survey found that while most of the brands, including Xiaomi, may end up losing market share, brands like OnePlus, Apple and Realme are set to grow. If the figures match this prediction, OnePlus may end up with market share of little over 18 per cent in future, ahead of all other smartphone companies.
This is because a lot of phone users are and this is according to the survey greedily looking at a OnePlus phone. The survey apparently asked users which phone they want to buy next and 12 per cent of all respondents pointed at the OnePlus. In other words, if OnePlus holds on to its current market share, and then adds the number of users that want its phone next, it may end up being the top phone company in India. Yes, it is the future and it is hard to predict since there are many variables but it does show that a OnePlus phone is something that people desire. In this desirability score, the next two brands after OnePlus, according to the survey, are Apple and Realme.As for the reasons behind the desirability for a OnePlus phone, we think the survey also hints at the reasons. Phones like the OnePlus 7, OnePlus 7T Pro, OnePlus 6T and particularly the just launched OnePlus 7T are extremely good phones. And just how good they are can be seen from what OnePlus users reveal. Here is what the 91Mobiles survey finds:
The survey finds that OnePlus users are particularly happy with the battery performance of the phone, with around 70 per cent of them giving it a thumbs up. Only Asus, which sees 75 per cent of its users liking the battery performance of their phone, is ahead.
When it comes to performance, OnePlus leads the chart with 88 per cent of OnePlus phone users finding the performance of their devices satisfactory. Apple is second here with 80 per cent of iPhone users happy with their phone’s performance.
While we tech writers and bloggers discuss the nuances and pixel peep into the kind of photos that devices like OnePlus 7 and OnePlus 6T click, OnePlus users are apparently happy with the camera performance of their phones. Nearly 70 per cent OnePlus users like the photos their phone clicks. Only Apple is ahead with nearly 72 per cent iPhone users liking the camera in their phones.
Given that OnePlus is a premium brand, albeit relatively more affordable than other similar brands, it also scores big in a few other key areas. In service quality, it leads the list with nearly 79 per cent users happy with its service. It also leads the list of brands delivering best value with nearly 88 per cent of users finding that they are getting their money’s worth from their OnePlus phone. And finally, it leads the list of brands that are going to retain most of its users, with 62 per cent of them saying that they are set on buying a OnePlus next time when they upgrade. On this list, OnePlus is closely followed by Apple which has 62 per cent loyal users."
https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/google-rolls-out-ramping-ringer-feature-to-pixel-phones-1617035-2019-11-08,y,"o you use a Google Pixel smartphone? Are you annoyed that your Pixel smartphone doesn't warn you before it starts ringing? If your answer to both those questions is yes then Google might have some good news for you. The company has rolled out a new feature on to its Google Pixel smartphones that makes the phone viberate before it rings.
According to a report by XDA Developers, which had first discovered this feature in the beta version of Android 10 back when it was Android Q, the Mountain View, California based tech giant has rolled out a new feature onto its Pixel smartphones that makes the phone viberate for five seconds before it starts ringing. The phone starts ringing at a lower volume before it gradually ramps up the volume within a span of 10 seconds.

This feature is available in the Sound section of the Pixel phone's Settings app. Up until now, Google used to give two vibration options - Never Vibrate and Always Vibrate - to its Pixel phone users. Now the company has added a third - Vibrate First Then Ring Gradually - option to the list. You can access these settings in the Vibrate for Calls sub-section of the Sound settings.
As per the report, this feature is available on the newly launched Pixel 4 and Pixel 4 XL smartphones. It is also available on older Pixel 3, Pixel 3 XL, Pixel 2, Pixel 2 XL and the first generation Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones.
It is worth noting that Google's first generation Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones missed the November security update. Shortly after, the company confirmed that it would release one final update to its first generation Pixel phones that would couple security updates from November and December. The fact that the newly introduced ramping ringer feature is also available on the Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones indicates that the feature is available independent of the software update which the company rolled out to its Pixel phones recently. This was confirmed by a separate report by Android Central wherein the folks at the publication were able to use the feature without installing the November security patch on their Pixel 4 XL smartphone."
https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-impeachment-idUSKBN1XI19R,n,"The White House blockade of the Democratic-led impeachment inquiry of President Donald Trump seemed likely to hold firm on Friday, as congressional officials said they expected two administration officials to rebuff a request to testify. The House of Representatives Intelligence Committee late on Thursday subpoenaed acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney to appear for a closed-door deposition on Friday, an official working on the impeachment inquiry said. 
The panel, along with the House Foreign Relations and Oversight committees, has also called Mark Sandy, associate director for national security programs at the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB), for interviews behind closed doors on Friday. 
Lawmakers want to ask Mulvaney and Sandy about OMB’s decision last summer to block, without explanation to Congress, nearly $400 million in security assistance for Ukraine that had been approved by lawmakers. 
Mulvaney, a former Republican House member, started his tenure at the Trump White House as director of the budget office. Due to his role at OMB, Sandy likely would have been involved in the decision. 
Congressional investigators are trying to determine whether Trump told the Kiev government it would not get the aid unless it agreed to launch an investigation of Hunter Biden, the son of former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden, one of Trump’s main Democratic rivals as he runs for re-election in 2020. 
Mulvaney acknowledged at an Oct. 17 news conference that the White House had withheld the assistance. “I have news for everybody: Get over it. There is going to be political influence in foreign policy,” Mulvaney said, although he later contradicted himself, saying in a White House statement: “There was absolutely no quid pro quo.” 

‘WITCH HUNT’ 
Trump has denied wrongdoing and disparaged the investigation as a politically motivated “witch hunt.” A White House spokesman said earlier this week that Mulvaney did not intend to comply with the request to appear.. 
Officials did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment on whether that still held, and on Sandy’s intentions. 
Mulvaney has also ignored an Oct. 4 subpoena from the House committees to provide documents for the investigation. 
Mulvaney is now Trump’s top aide, and the White House, claiming executive privilege, has argued that any official close to Trump should not have to provide depositions to congressional investigators. 
So far, most officials who work in the executive branch have declined to cooperate with the investigation, although an adviser to Vice President Mike Pence appeared as requested on Thursday. 
The House committees dispute the privilege argument. “As Mulvaney knows from his previous service in the House of Representatives, both Republican and Democratic-led committees have conducted depositions for decades with high-level White House aides - include White House Chiefs of Staff,” they said in an emailed statement. 
The three House committees are wrapping up the closed-door phase of their investigation before open hearings start next Wednesday with testimony from two diplomats who have been interviewed behind closed doors, William Taylor, the top U.S. diplomat in Ukraine, and Deputy Assistant Secretary of State George Kent. 
This week, the committees have been releasing transcripts of the closed-door interviews, including with Taylor, Kent and former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who appears at a public hearing on Nov. 15."
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/22/sports/soccer/premier-league-transfers.html,y,"For the better part of a decade, at least one leading Premier League team has devoted thousands of hours and kilowatts of brain power to answering what sounds, on the surface, like a simple question: How do you judge what any one player is actually worth?

Every conceivable variable is taken into account, the tangible and the intangible, the objective and the subjective. In addition to thousands of data points breaking down each player?s performance and output, factors like his age, position, nationality, length of contract and commercial value are fed into the equation. So, too, are the buying power of the player?s current club, and the cost of his peers and, adjusting for inflation, his predecessors.

The model is always being refined, but still, the club feels that it is as robust a valuation system as exists in soccer. It does not calculate a precise figure. Instead, it provides a guideline as to what might be a reasonable fee for any target the manager chooses to pursue, a general idea of that player?s actual economic value.

Those who have developed and fine-tuned the system know that figure rarely bears much relation to the price they will be quoted once soccer?s transfer window ? that dizzying, desensitizing biannual bazaar ? opens for business.

After all, as Chelsea Manager Antonio Conte said last year, this is soccer?s ?crazy? age.

?Prices are too high in general; the market is crazy,? he said. ?When you try to buy a player, the cost is very expensive. It is not the real valuation of the player. It is a very strange situation.?

Events so far this summer ? before the window has even opened ? have only compounded that impression.

Those inside soccer have long since grown used to spiraling price inflation, driven by the wealth of the cash-soaked Premier League, the rising revenues of the superclubs of Continental Europe and the ever-present threat of the riches being offered by teams in the Chinese Super League.

What leaves even those employed to track the pulse of the transfer market scratching their heads is that there is no pattern to the prices that they are being quoted. Nobody seems sure anymore of exactly what, in Conte?s words, ??the real valuation? of a player should be.

Everton, for example, valued its striker, Romelu Lukaku, at 100 million pounds (about $126 million), the same figure that Barcelona may have to pay to extricate the Italian midfielder Marco Verratti from Paris St.-Germain. Yet beyond their age (24), Lukaku, a powerful Belgian forward, and Verratti, a creative and technical Italian playmaker, have little in common: They share neither position nor pedigree.

Even prices for theoretically comparable players offer no clear signals. Manchester United recently paid Benfica 30 million pounds (nearly $38 million) for one of its crown jewels, Victor Lindelof, a 22-year-old Swedish defender. But Liverpool wants the same amount for Mamadou Sakho, a defender five years older than Lindelof who was ostracized by Manager Jrgen Klopp for much of last year. Southampton believes its defender Virgil van Dijk is worth twice as much as Lindelof and Sakho.

Increasingly, it seems as though people are just sticking a finger in the air and seeing which way the wind is blowing.

Until a couple of weeks ago, for example, Stoke City might have contemplated an offer of 30 million pounds for its young English goalkeeper, Jack Butland. But after Everton agreed to pay Sunderland that amount for a different young English goalkeeper, Jordan Pickford, Stoke adjusted its sights accordingly. Butland is still the same player. It is just that he will now cost any team hoping to buy him substantially more.

The market can move values, of course, but so can the environment. Last year, when Newcastle United was relegated from the Premier League, it knew it would have to cash in on its two most salable assets, the French midfielder Moussa Sissoko and the Dutch wing Georginio Wijnaldum.Privately, the club believed that 15 million pounds would be a healthy price for each player. When Real Madrid inquired about Sissoko and suggested, without prompting, that it would be prepared to pay twice that, Newcastle duly increased its valuation. When news media reports suggested that Wijnaldum might fetch 25 million pounds ? and his two most active suitors, Everton and Liverpool, were not deterred ? Newcastle did the same with him. Both players soon departed, each at the new prices.

That is an extreme example, but at many clubs setting a price remains a matter of instinct, of feel. Igli Tare, the sporting director of the Italian club Lazio, takes into account many of the same metrics a more formal system might ? ?age, importance to the team, the quality of their play in the last seasons? ? but said that the ultimate filter remained his ?knowledge and understanding of the transfer market.?

That personal, instinctive approach is replicated across the Continent, leading to intense secrecy: Few teams and officials are willing to speak openly about how they go about setting the prices they will accept, or pay.

?It is like a secret recipe for every club, known only in the club and in our books,? said Olaf Rebbe, the sporting director at the Bundesliga club Wolfsburg. ?Every club decides in its own way what a player costs, and that could be completely different to you.?

This is also what lends the transfer market its veneer of chaos, the sense that even experts are grasping in the dark: each club and each individual acting according to a value system only they know, and having a willingness to change it from case to case. ?Every player depends so much on the details,? Rebbe said.

Both Rebbe and Tare, for example, insisted that they work ?with one price in mind? when selling a player, regardless of the buyer. But many English clubs have complained that they are routinely cited higher figures when buying players in Europe than are teams from Germany, Italy or Spain.

It is no wonder, then, that many teams see modeling transfer prices as a task too thankless to contemplate. Though Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea all work to some sort of formal methodology, the staff of StatDNA, Arsenal?s analytics arm, argues that every deal is too dependent on context to create a coherent approach.

Even those who have spent time doing so accept its limitations. ?We have built models for market valuations,? said Henry Stott, founder of Decision Technology, a research consultancy that provides advice to a number of high-profile teams. ?But they are only so good, because there are a million unobserved facts.?

Instead, Stott, who has a doctorate in cognitive science, and his team of academics concentrate on offering a ?rational figure for a reservation price? ? an idea of roughly what a player should be worth in cold monetary terms.

By using data to establish a reliable system of ranking players in any one position by ability, Stott said, they can try to establish the effect on a team of ?pulling one player out and putting another in, what that would mean in terms of likelihood of avoiding relegation, qualifying for Europe or where you would finish in the league.?

That provides what Stott refers to as an ?intrinsic valuation.? That is helpful information, most agree, even if the ?intuitive price? ? what a team may end up paying ? is ordinarily, and often substantially, different.

?Market price is determined by willingness to sell and willingness to buy,? Stott said, as well as a number of other factors. ?People pay less to smaller clubs for players of the same caliber, for example,? he added.

The models, the science, the research, all of those hours of work and all of that brainpower, can take a team only so far. Ultimately, no matter what the actual value of a player is, or how inflated or inexplicable the figures seem, the only measure of worth that counts is what someone is willing to pay.

Establishing that price, Stott said, is not his role. ?I hand it across to the negotiating team,? he said. He restricts his advice to one simple message. ?If you can get the player for that or less, you should,? he tells his clients. ?But if you have to pay more, maybe don?t.?"
https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2019/06/20/real-reason-us-womens-soccer-team-isnt-getting-equal-pay/,y,"In a dazzling display of skill, the U.S. women?s soccer team outscored the opposition a combined 16-0 in its first two games in the Women?s World Cup. The opening victory over Thailand (a 13-0 win) broke the World Cup record for largest margin of victory in a game and most goals scored in a single match ? men?s or women?s.

This decisive win not only showcased the athletes? impressive talent, but it also provided evidence supporting their demand for equal pay, training and traveling conditions. In a lawsuit filed in March, 28 members of the team alleged that U.S. Soccer has ?stubbornly refused to treat its female employees who are members of the WNT equally to its male employees who are members of the MNT.? This mistreatment occurs despite the fact that the women?s record, with three World Cup titles and four Olympic gold medals, is far better than the men?s. The women have also brought in more revenue than the men?s squad.

But there is an area where the women remain severely outmatched, one that helps explain the disparity in treatment of the men?s and women?s teams: the boardroom. And only by changing this will female athletes be treated equally.The percentage of women in leadership roles plummeted for several reasons. When the NCAA added championships for women?s sports, most member institutions opted to send both their male and female teams to the NCAA competitions rather than maintain membership in separate governing bodies. This led to the demise of the AIAW in 1982 and consequently diminished the number of female executives in college sports. With the consolidation of authority under the NCAA, most schools then combined their men?s and women?s athletic departments, placing men at the helm as athletic directors."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/global-opinions/wp/2018/06/18/why-china-doesnt-dominate-soccer/,y,"Stefan Szymanski is a professor of sports management at the University of Michigan. He is the co-author of ?Soccernomics? and ?It?s Football, Not Soccer (and Vice Versa).?

The most populous nation on Earth is not playing in the 2018 World Cup. Soccer is China?s most popular sport, but its current FIFA world ranking is No. 75. What accounts for this disastrous showing?

China has become an Olympic powerhouse. Since 2000, it has consistently ranked in the top three in medals earned at the Summer Games, and in the top 16 at the Winter Games. But China has managed to qualify for the World Cup only once, in 2002, when it proceeded to lose all three of its group matches and failed to score a single goal. How can a country be so dominant in Olympic sports and so awful at soccer?

China?s soccer troubles are a case study in the limits of authoritarianism. When the government decided to allocate significant resources toward Olympic success ? a process that included recruiting children as young as 6 years old, often separating them from their parents, and, as most experts believe and the World Anti-Doping Agency may soon show, using performance-enhancing drugs with abandon ? they achieved their goals. In many Olympic sports, high performance is a matter of biomechanics and discipline. To be sure, neither are irrelevant to soccer ? but they are not decisive, and too much discipline can actually be a handicap.

Compare that archetype of authoritarian Olympism: East Germany. The country amassed a record number of medals over two decades (thanks in part to a state-sponsored doping program). In contrast, East Germany attempted to qualify for the World Cup nine times and managed to get in only once (1974). The liberal democracy of West Germany lagged well behind their East German counterparts in the Olympic medal tables, but won the World Cup in 1954, 1974 and 1990, and reached the final in 1966, 1982 and 1986.

The mighty Soviet Union also dominated the Olympics and still ranks second in the all-time combined medals table. And though not as hapless as China or East Germany, Soviet soccer was a hit-and-miss affair. The USSR reached the World Cup quarterfinals four times between 1958 and 1970 and the semifinals in 1966, but between 1970 and 1990, it barely made an impact. It fared better in the European Championship, which it won in 1960, and finished second in 1964, 1972 and 1988. Then again, it failed to qualify altogether between 1976 and 1984.

Soccer has not succumbed to central planning because the game has proved resistant to scientific analysis. We?re not even sure what a player?s ideal physique may be. It is a contact sport, so you would expect top players to have some heft, but three of the greatest players of all time are decidedly on the short side: Brazil?s Pele is 5-foot-8, while Argentina?s Diego Maradona and Lionel Messi are 5-foot-5 and 5-foot-7, respectively.

Training and drills do not appear to make too much of a difference. Most statistical research suggests soccer coaches have a relatively small impact on a team?s success. Unlike American football, soccer is a free-flowing game of infinite, largely unpredictable variety with relatively little use for rehearsed ?plays.?

The Dutch superstar Johan Cruyff once said ?you play football with your head, and your legs are there to help you.? Physical fitness and some measure of organization and structure are certainly helpful, but each player must be able to strategize on the fly, individually. This means you can certainly improve a terrible team?s performance by focusing on the basics, as many of the world?s weaker nations have done over the past decades, but true success depends on factors that remain elusive. Instead, World Cup victories tend to be associated with the mercurial skills of the iconic players: Pele in 1970, Italy?s Paolo Rossi in 1982, Maradona in 1986, France?s Zinedine Zidane in 1998. Almost everyone thinks the outcome of this World Cup will depend on the performances of Portugal?s Cristiano Ronaldo, Messi and Brazil?s Neymar.

President Xi Jinping of China, a passionate soccer fan, is committed to raising his country?s game, with an ambitious plan that includes creating 50,000 soccer schools by 2025, up from around 5,000 in 2015.

But no centralized program will create the kind of player who creatively dribbles and dances his team to victory. In fact, the more you plan and the more you dictate, the less likely you are to rise beyond mediocrity. There is a lesson here for the United States as well: American mainstream sports tend to rely heavily on the authoritarian figure of the coach, who draws up plays for obedient players to execute. It is an interesting paradox: in its sports culture, the nation that prides itself on a free-wheeling and nearly unbridled individualism actually encourages unquestioning submission in its popular sports and, far too often, you see well-meaning soccer parents preach to their children about iron discipline when they ought to tell them to express their free spirits on the field.

It is no accident that the nation that has won the World Cup more times than any other and has exported the most talent to the rest of the world is synonymous with the most flamboyant, Carnival-esque expression of o jogo bonito, or the beautiful game: spirited Brazil."
https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/3910275/chelseas-christian-pulisic-is-not-your-wonderboy-anymore,y,"Christian Pulisic is but 20 years old and the number of effusive words already written about him is staggering.

His classic speed. His majestic acceleration. His touch, which allows him to keep the ball so close to his feet that defenders can only trip or wave at him as he flies past. The near clairvoyance with which he finds space amid a thicket of defenders near the goal. The way he shoots, like an archer. The way he sets his jaw, like a bouncer.

To be clear, the enthusiasm is warranted. Christian Pulisic is the most talented player in American soccer history. And, should he pull it off, what he is about to do -- that is, play for Chelsea in the English Premier League -- will be one of the most impressive feats in American sports history. Yes, Tim Howard played for Manchester United, but he was a goalkeeper; and yes, Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan made the move to the EPL as well, but they debuted at smaller clubs in Fulham and Everton.

Pulisic is different. By joining Chelsea, he is the first American aiming to star for one of the game's largest clubs. Nearly half the population of the planet watches the Premier League, more than 3 billion people a season. If Pulisic, a young, fresh-faced American, succeeds -- if he scores and dazzles and captivates fans in the U.S. and Europe and China and India and all over Africa -- it changes the calculus on him. His ceiling isn't Landon Donovan anymore. It's Lionel Messi.On a dank day in Dortmund, Germany, this spring, I meet Pulisic at a restaurant in the city center. He is dressed Euro-casual, in tight jeans and a black hoodie. I notice the sweatshirt right away because it has words written in circles on the sleeves.

""It's from the Uninterrupted guys,"" he says. ""LeBron started this thing with 'More Than an Athlete,' and they sent me one.""

Pulisic typically has presented himself as more quiet than brash, but knowing the move he's about to make, the sweatshirt makes me wonder if something has changed. It wouldn't be crazy. Science tells us that if a person picks up two objects at the same time and they have identical weights but different sizes, the larger object is the one that will actually seem lighter. (It's true: Try it with an iPhone and a Kindle.)

This phenomenon has to do with the incredible power of human expectations: We expect the bigger thing to be heavier, so it feels lighter. In sports, the work of becoming a legend is the same either way, but if you make it look bigger, then actually doing the lifting might feel easier. Many superstars have done it this way: Tiger Woods when he said ""Hello, world""; LeBron when he welcomed comparisons to Michael Jordan before he was out of high school.

So maybe Pulisic has decided he wants the attention and limelight and microphones that will come at Chelsea. Maybe he is ready to stand up and make a grander statement on, say, pay equity in soccer or the development model in the United States. Maybe he wants to speak.

""You're part of it then?"" I ask Pulisic about Uninterrupted. His forehead crinkles. His eyes drop.

""Um, not like part of it,"" he says. ""I support it, I guess you could say."" Later, he explains that the fame and the platform might be the bit about his Chelsea move that most challenges him, because he doesn't particularly like being famous.

Fair enough, I tell him, except he just made a career move that guarantees the greatest scrutiny an American soccer player has ever received. He sighs.

""It's definitely one of the hardest parts of my life,"" he says, stressing that he really does appreciate having fans who support him and really does understand why people stop him for a selfie or an autograph.

""I just hope people realize it's tougher for some of us,"" he says. His voice lowers. ""At times, you just want to be alone.""I have schnitzel, Pulisic has a salad, and then he leads me through the Borussia Dortmund locker room at the team's stadium. He stops in front of his locker and explains, with a touch of wistfulness, that when he saw his jersey hanging there for the first time in 2016, it was the ""coolest thing in the world.""

Outside on the field, standing in front of the towering south stand where 25,000 fans crowd together to form the so-called Yellow Wall during games, he almost giggles as he reminisces about the noise in the stadium after a goal.

""You hear the stadium announcer yell 'Christian!' and then everyone yells your last name back,"" he says, cocking his head as though it is echoing right now. ""I mean, scoring a last-minute goal in front of this wall, and you see the beer flying everywhere and ...""

His voice trails off. Leaving for Chelsea might have been a fairly straightforward business decision for Pulisic, but the departure from Dortmund is difficult. Dortmund was a haven for Pulisic, a place to develop his game and discover how he wanted to present himself as an athlete. In soccer terms, Dortmund was Pulisic's boyhood home.

- When does the transfer window close?

Club scouts found him when he was 15, smitten after watching Pulisic play at a U.S. youth national team tournament in Turkey. They saw then what Chelsea officials see now: a soft, silken touch more European than American. For Dortmund, which has a renowned youth development academy, he seemed a perfect fit.

""We only sign players from foreign countries if we're extremely confident that he's becoming a player for the professional team,"" Lars Ricken, Dortmund's youth coordinator, tells me at the team's training facility, adding that he sees Pulisic as one of the club's biggest success stories.

Pulisic arrived in Germany from Hershey, Pennsylvania, when he was 16. He initially struggled with school -- to this day, he says, he's still not sure what classes he attended at first since he didn't understand a word of German at the time -- but blossomed quickly on the field.

Many soccer analysts say success at the highest levels of the sport comes down to millimeters. If the space between the ball and a player's foot is much wider than that, he isn't truly in control of it. Pulisic's gap, even as a teenager and even when he was sprinting, was minuscule. He was called up to Dortmund's first team in less than a year. ""We don't buy stars,"" Ricken says now, with obvious pride. ""We build them.""

Pulisic became the youngest non-German to ever score in the Bundesliga (he celebrated by dabbing). Then he became the youngest Dortmund player to ever play in the Champions League. He appeared in 127 games over four seasons for Dortmund and helped the team win the German Cup in 2017.

Along the way, he hung on to plenty of his American tendencies -- ""I remember him driving like two hours to Frankfurt to get burritos sometimes,"" says Dortmund winger Jacob Bruun Larsen, his former roommate -- but he also worked to connect with the city and the fans. Instead of sloughing off the language barrier, he embraced it, practicing his German to the point where he was able to do interviews on television. His grammar wasn't perfect, but the effort endeared him to the team's supporters.They loved that he tried, loved that he put his head down and grinded in the blue-collar image of Dortmund players who came before him. He trained rigorously and diligently. He battled against juggernaut Bayern Munich. He scored important goals, like the gorgeous lob over Benfica's goalkeeper in the Champions League. He also suffered through one of the worst weeks in the club's history. In 2017, as the team traveled from its hotel to the stadium, its bus was struck by explosives planted by a deranged fan.

Pulisic has rarely spoken about that episode, and his eyes soften as he recounts the fear he felt when the windows of the bus exploded and rockets of glass flew everywhere. ""We were just going to a normal game, like always, and there was just a really loud bang,"" he says. ""It was so loud, I couldn't hear anything. I was confused.""

He pauses. ""I just remember [Dortmund goalkeeper] Roman Burki next to me grabbed me and pulled me under the table because he probably recognized what was going on before I did. We were just so scared.""

Pulisic looks away, his voice slowing down. ""And then I hear Marc screaming. ... He was right across from me. ... And I see blood. ... And he's yelling for the doctor. And everyone's screaming at the bus driver, 'Driver, keep going!'""

Marc Bartra, a defender, was struck by the glass and had shards embedded in his arm. He underwent emergency surgery that night. There were no other serious physical injuries among the players, but the emotional fallout from the episode was significant. Pulisic was 18, living on his own in Germany.

He had to deal with knowing someone had tried to kill him and his friends. He had to deal with staying at the same hotel before another game. He had to deal with getting back on the team bus without feeling his skin crawl. He had to figure out how to process it.

It was a hyperintense event within a hyperspeed maturation. Pulisic learned how to shop for groceries in Dortmund, how to cook for himself in Dortmund, how to get ready for work each day in Dortmund. After the bus attack, he learned how to confront his own demons and move on from a nightmare in Dortmund.

""I've changed a lot,"" he says at one point, ""a lot on the soccer field but maybe even more off the field.""

As we walk back up from the locker room, he looks around and says, ""In a lot of ways, I grew up here."""
https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/06/25/how-we-watch-soccer-now,y,"In soccer terms, I am what is known as a ?neutral,? someone who loves the sport but doesn?t follow any particular club or team. This comes with certain drawbacks?requiring me, for instance, to devote energy and interest to all twenty participants in the English Premier League, the most competitive and popular in the world, as well as to the ‚lite clubs from the other European soccer countries. Now and again, some turn of events?a wonder goal, or horror tackle, or unexpected trade?will force me to dig a little into the Superliga Argentina or the Brasileir?o, where many of the best players start out but never stay. And when I?m feeling curious or apprehensive about the future of the game, and about the sheer range of soccer I might one day feel obliged to obsess over, I?ll read up on Major League Soccer or the Chinese Super League?generally agreed to be rising forces, though still currently a place for second-rank talent and the occasional fading, pampered megastar.

Yet I am considered one of the lucky ones. Not long ago, in central London, I bumped into a male acquaintance and we started talking soccer. I mentioned in passing that I don?t support a team, and he groaned, envying my freedom to ?simply drift with the action,? when he had spent his life ?chained by the ankle to Tottenham Hotspur.? When Immanuel Kant defined the true judgment of beauty as existing ?apart from any interest,? he was also describing the charmed position of the modern soccer neutral?able, say, to admire Lionel Messi?s turbocharged yet feathery left foot, on display for Barcelona, without the mildest twinge of annoyance that he doesn?t play for ?us.?

My neutralism has its limits: I will doggedly follow the progress of England?s national team in the World Cup, which is now under way in Russia. But when England is, inevitably, knocked out?by the quarter-finals, in all likelihood?I will soon put it out of my mind and turn to the truly meaningful business of watching teams like Germany, Spain, and Brazil. It remains to be seen whether American enthusiasm will survive the U.S. team?s failure even to qualify, but there?s every reason to hope that it will. A recent Gallup poll found that soccer was the favorite sport to watch for seven per cent of Americans?higher than hockey, and only slightly lower than baseball. Then, there?s the matter of the World Cup?s peculiar pull. The sixty-four matches at the last tournament attracted a cumulative audience of more than three billion. With the possible exceptions of the Olympic Games and the verdict of a papal conclave, no other recurring event is capable of inspiring so much global fervor.But, unlike the Olympics?the only occasion when most people have any time for figure skating or race walking?the World Cup serves as a quadrennial testament to soccer?s year-round appeal. By any number of metrics, it is the most popular sport on earth, and the current tournament arrives at a moment of new highs. The leading European leagues?England, France, Germany, Spain, Italy?generated almost eighteen billion dollars during the 2016-17 season, a nine-per-cent increase, and Manchester United recently posted record annual revenues for a single club (around eight hundred million dollars). Television broadcast rights continue to fetch eye-watering sums, and, earlier this month, Amazon entered the soccer market for the first time. The Portuguese player Cristiano Ronaldo has a larger Instagram following?a hundred and twenty-eight million?than anyone except Selena Gomez, and is the most highly paid sports star in the world, outpacing LeBron James and Roger Federer. And the World Cup has brought a shelf of new and updated books treating the subject from every conceivable angle: from social history to tactical minutiae, and from soccer?s future as an outpost of Big Data to its ever-growing status as an object of aesthetic wonder.

For most of soccer?s history, the idea of nonpartisan connoisseurship would have been unthinkable. From its earliest days as a traditional English pastime, the game was a tribal affair?defined by one historian as ?more or less institutionalized violence between villages or different parts of villages.? By 1600, it had been banned by Edward II, Edward III, Richard II, Henry IV, Henry V, Henry VII, Henry VIII, James I of Scotland, James IV of Scotland, and Elizabeth I. Yet these edicts had little effect on the game?s appeal or on its unruliness. In the sixteen-sixties, Samuel Pepys noted that London, one frosty morning, was full of footballs. In 1817, Walter Scott informed his friend Washington Irving, who was visiting Scotland, that it wasn?t safe for local teams to play against each other: ?the old clannish spirit was too apt to break out.?

As Tony Collins recounts in a brisk forthcoming survey, ?How Football Began? (Routledge), the game?s transformation from folk pursuit to global industry began in the ‚lite British schools of the nineteenth century, where Anglican educators such as Thomas Arnold, the headmaster of Rugby School, promoted sports as a way of harnessing youthful energies that had previously found rebellious outlets. Arnold?s tenure was memorialized in Thomas Hughes?s autobiographical novel, ?Tom Brown?s Schooldays? (1857), and, with cooler retrospect, by Lytton Strachey, in ?Eminent Victorians? (1918). Strachey presented Arnold as an ?earnest enthusiast? who, in his efforts to make his pupils Christian gentlemen, merely insured that the English schoolboy with no interest in soccer became ?a contradiction in terms.?

The game?s growth beyond these enclaves was hampered by a lack of central planning. ?Football,? in the mid-nineteenth century, was played with sufficient variation to serve as a forerunner not only of soccer but of rugby football, Australian-rules football, and gridiron football. (When ?Tom Brown?s Schooldays? was published in the U.S., it sold two hundred and twenty-five thousand copies in a year.) Attempts to introduce the game at Cambridge University during the eighteen-forties foundered, because, as one student wrote, ?every man played the rules he had been accustomed to at his public school. I remember how the Eton men howled at the Rugby men for handling the ball.? A compromise, the Cambridge Rules, was drawn up and a campaign for universal standards spread. In 1863, representatives from eleven clubs formed the Football Association?the term ?soccer? is a contraction of ?association football??and set about devising the Laws of the Game, which included the maximum length of the pitch (two hundred yards) and a prohibition on throwing the ball. Later additions mandated the number of players (eleven a side) and introduced the referee, the goal net, the crossbar, the free kick, and the dreaded penalty spot.At first, soccer was a genteel sport?among the F.A.?s founding members was a team fielded by the civil service?but it gradually caught on in the industrial North. Legislation had shortened the Saturday workday, introducing the distinctive leisure period known as the ?week-end,? and employers, like headmasters a few decades earlier, began promoting the game as a wholesome pastime for their workers. In the eighteen-seventies, the arrival of cup competitions, both national and regional, ?rapidly and unexpectedly became a focus for local pride and civic rivalries,? Collins writes. Teams from mill towns like Darwen and Blackburn could play against each other as well as against the Old Etonians.

Before long, merchants, engineers, travel agents, and seamen took the new pastime abroad, founding the first soccer clubs in Germany, Spain, France, Argentina, and Russia. In Brazil, the game was introduced by Charles William Miller, the S?o Paulo-born son of a Scottish railway engineer, who went to school in England and returned in the eighteen-nineties with a pair of leather balls and a copy of the rules from the Hampshire branch of the F.A. (His legacy as the man who brought soccer to perhaps the most besotted of all soccer nations endures in a cross-legged maneuver known as the chaleira.) Even countries with their own footballing traditions embraced the new, codified sport. In Italy, although soccer is still known as calcio?after a Florentine game that originated in the sixteenth century?the British influence is enshrined in such Anglicized names as A.C. Milan, one of the country?s most distinguished club sides.

Collins credits soccer?s global success to its early embrace of meritocracy. In 1888, the F.A., three years after permitting players to go professional, established the Football League, with a season-long calendar of home-and-away fixtures?developments rightly perceived as threatening to the Victorian cult of the gentleman amateur, which continued to rule cricket and rugby. The model of organized competition, financed by a paying audience, could be emulated elsewhere, thereby liberating soccer from English oversight. As far afield as Buenos Aires, rugby matches were controlled by the Rugby Football Union, but every soccer country was free to start its own association; in 1904, a world governing body, FIFA, was founded, with seven members.

The F.A. wasn?t among them. Foreigners? soccer was viewed with haughty indifference by the English soccer establishment. Charles Sutcliffe, the president of the Football League in the nineteen-twenties, boasted that he didn?t know the name of a single club or individual on the Continent who was involved in soccer. But chauvinism came at a cost: an independent scene was developing, and isolation bred stasis. After the 1924 Olympics, Gabriel Hanot, a French player, said that comparing the Uruguay team, which won, to England?s team, which had refused to take part, was ?like comparing Arab thoroughbreds to farm horses.? By 1930, the year of the first FIFA World Cup, in which the U.S. competed but England did not, Jimmy Hogan, an English former player who had spent his coaching career abroad, complained, ?We are absolutely out of date.? Soccer, as played in its mother country, remained primitive in technique and tactically complacent, with an emphasis on moral fibre that had begun to look increasingly quixotic.The illusion of superiority survived into the postwar period, sustained by the fact that the national team had never lost on its home turf. But in 1953 Hungary, fielding a strong side known ever after as the Mighty Magyars, travelled to London and won 6?3. (In one match report, an overzealous English defender, having been wrong-footed by a Hungarian, was described as rushing past his opponent ?like a fire engine going to the wrong fire.?) Some pride was salvaged the next year when Wolverhampton Wanderers defeated Budapest Honv‚d; the Daily Mail called the Wolves team ?champions of the world.? But the renewed conviction that British was still best became untenable after the establishment, in the 1955-56 season, of the European Cup. The English Football League forbade its clubs to enter?the chairman declared that the Continental game had ?too many wogs and dagos??and, though Manchester United ignored the ban, the Cup?s early years were dominated by Real Madrid and Benfica.

The emergence of an international soccer scene prompted the first stirrings of interest from a neutral perspective. A. J. Liebling, covering the 1952 Helsinki Olympics for this magazine, attended a game between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, and admired the ?speed and intricacy of the play,?and ?the legerdepied of the dribbler who seems to offer the ball to his charging opponent and then takes it away, leaving the opponent prone.? Reflecting on the 1954 World Cup, the first to be televised in Britain, the former Arsenal player Bernard Joy wrote that the viewers at home had been ?impressed by the attractive, artistic way the leading foreign teams played. . . . We murmured, ?Good football,? about them as though it had nothing to do with the winning of matches.? Soccer?s cultural recognition was broadened by television?in the past, geography had more or less dictated access?and also by a series of dramatic events that made a claim on general attention. In the next decade and a half, England had its first soccer tragedy, the Munich air disaster, in which eight Manchester United players died; its first soccer superstar, George Best, the so-called fifth Beatle; its first and only World Cup victory; its first knighthoods for a soccer player and a manager. English soccer was at last becoming part of the global game.

Between the visit of the Mighty Magyars and England?s World Cup victory, in 1966, British fans began to learn the names of foreign stars and even, as the journalist Brian Glanville noted, ?managed to pronounce them correctly.? Soon there was foreign vocabulary, too: the Italian defensive strategy, catenaccio; the wandering ?sweeper? position, the libero; the Dutch tactical revolution, totaalvoetbal. Total Football, made famous by Johan Cruijff, a star player for the Amsterdam team Ajax and for Barcelona, promoted possession-based soccer?retaining the ball through short, precise passes, rather than risk losing it by booting up the field?with every player equipped, at least in theory, to occupy every role on the pitch.

Britain?s soccer culture appeared to be growing more relaxed and receptive. The ranks of sports journalists were joined by the philosopher A. J. Ayer, the Viennese ‚migr‚ musician Hans Keller, and John Sparrow, the warden of All Souls College, Oxford. In his chirpy ?History of British Football? (1968), the musicologist Percy M. Young identified the arrival of a recognizable new type?the soccer connoisseur, who would watch only ?attractive football.? But even among connoisseurs tribalism often won out; the point of soccer was still to chant and cheer, not analyze and admire. The television presenter Michael Parkinson wrote that, despite having seen Real Madrid and A.C. Milan play, he had ?never got over Barnsley,? the Yorkshire team to which his father had introduced him as a boy. In 1980, the Labour M.P. Roy Hattersley estimated that although England might contain ?a few thousand purists who see football as an art and watch it to enjoy the objective beauty of rhythm and form,? it remained to a very large degree a pastime for partisans: ?The rest of us want to see our team win.?

Wanting to see that happen more than most were the diehard followers, the hooligans, both in Britain and in the rest of Europe, whose brawling tarnished the game. After an accidental fire at a stadium in Bradford, in 1985, the London Sunday Times called soccer ?a slum sport played in slum stadiums and increasingly watched by slum people, who deter decent folk from turning up.? Later the same year, at the European Cup Final, in Brussels, a charge of Liverpool fans caused a stadium wall to collapse, killing thirty-nine people, most of them supporters of the Turin team Juventus. (English clubs were banned from European competitions for five years.) Clubs became preoccupied with crowd control, often herding groups of spectators into large metal pens, and in 1989, at Hillsborough, in Sheffield, ninety-six Liverpool fans were crushed to death. The Economist ran a cover with the headline ?The game that died.?But it hadn?t. Barely a year later, soccer was the game that survived and prospered. The England team excelled in the 1990 World Cup, reaching the semifinals. The BBC gave the tournament a self-consciously upmarket presentation, with Pavarotti singing ?Nessun Dorma,? and England?s young star, Paul Gascoigne, known universally as Gazza, emerged as a national figure when he broke down in tears during a match. A report commissioned by the British government recommended getting rid of the traditional, standing-room-only ?terraces??a measure widely resented as an attempt to gentrify the game. But the all-seater stadiums that replaced them, and the higher ticket prices they necessitated, were not the only factor in soccer?s social shakeup. Chairmen and media executives had been conspiring to introduce the sport to modern capitalism. In 1992, the highest tier of the English Football League, the First Division, spun itself off into an autonomous corporate entity, the Premier League, enabling the big teams to negotiate their own lucrative television deal, with Rupert Murdoch?s recently formed satellite service.

It was at this juncture that ?Fever Pitch,? Nick Hornby?s memoir about his obsessive support for Arsenal, was published, just in time to attract a large, educated readership newly interested in the game. Hornby accepted the post-Hillsborough reforms, reasoning that ?the end of terrace culture? would not mean ?the end of noise and atmosphere and all the things that make football memorable.? Yet his book also served as a rebuke to a new kind of soccer engagement. He identified himself as ?an Arsenal fan first and a football fan second,? and wrote with detachment verging on contempt about ?the middle-class football fans? who admire the ?cerebral attributes? of certain players. Some people might applaud the virtuosity of opposition players, or lose themselves in ?the patterns and rhythms of football without caring about the score,? but that wasn?t fandom. Arsenal?s particular style of play ?is beside the point for most of us,? he wrote. ?I go to football for loads of reasons, but I don?t go for entertainment.? Nonetheless, football was becoming subsumed into the entertainment industry. ?Fever Pitch? soon became a movie, with Colin Firth in the Hornby role.

When I first got into soccer, as a child, in the early nineties, it looked as if I were doomed to be one of those people who, in Roy Hattersley?s phrase, inherit ?their fathers? frustrations.? Initially, it didn?t seem as if the frustration would be too great: in 1992, my dad?s team, Leeds United, won the First Division, just before it became the Premier League. But the next season Manchester United emerged as the dominant side, destroying the competition week after week. A reporter and Manchester United fan named Jim White sensed that history was being made, and decided to write a book about the team?s progress. White was a family friend, so when the team played Leeds he took me along.

In his book, ?Are You Watching, Liverpool?? (1995), White wrote about my eight-year-old self, expressing surprise that I enjoyed the game even though Leeds lost: ?I looked at him and saw the picture of awed excitement his face had become and said that I thought he wasn?t really a Leeds fan.? He?d noticed how much I loved a song the Manchester fans sang in praise of one of their players, and suggested that my avowed support of Leeds was just a way of sparing my father?s feelings. It didn?t occur to him that I was developing an appetite for the sport per se?that I?d have considered it ungrateful to dismiss the winning side?s attacking flair simply because my father happened to have come from a different northern city. My dispassionate leanings were vindicated a couple of months later, when the U.S. hosted the World Cup. England had failed to qualify, but how much did that really matter, when you had Italy, Holland, Brazil? Like Liebling in Finland, I was free to admire the legerdepied."

A steady drizzle fell on Portland on the evening of March 27. By six o?clock traffic had snarled. It wasn?t much of a night for a preseason soccer friendly?still, some 2,000 diehards ventured out to watch the local pro women?s team take on the U.S.?s U-23 squad.

The first half proved uneventful. The Portland Thorns were missing Tobin Heath and Lindsey Horan, both senior national team stars. As the second half began, a new player came on for the Thorns. Unlisted in the program and smaller than most of her peers, number 42 wore bright red cleats and a high bun. Appearing tentative, she lost the ball a few times, won it back once and came off early to huddle with trainers, thoroughly gassed. Which made sense. After all, she was only 13. 

Thirteen is when most girls go through seventh grade. When puberty arrives, with its blooms of acne and social anxiety. When the world begins to feel incredibly small. In the case of Olivia Moultrie, it?s also when she signed a six-figure deal with Nike, becoming the youngest pro women?s soccer player in the history of such things, moving with her family to Portland to train with the Thorns, the dominant franchise in the National Women?s Soccer League.

No precedent exists. Horan and Mallory Pugh (another national teamer) skipped college to go pro, but they were both 18 and came up through youth leagues. Olivia did not. By seven she had a personal coach. At 10 she became the youngest girl ever to train full-time with boys in the U.S. Soccer Development Academy; at 11, the youngest to accept a scholarship offer, from powerhouse North Carolina. Her parents, K.C. and Jessica, installed a turf field in their backyard and homeschooled Olivia so she could train eight hours a day. K.C. tagged social media posts about his daughter #witness and last September, The New York Times quoted him saying, ?I tell her all the time, ?Nobody cares that you?re the best at 12. If you?re not the best at 17 or 18, nobody?s going to care.??

Now, as Olivia?s age-group peers catch rides to tournaments and muddle through middle school, she wears a GPS tracker and practices with the likes of Canadian striker Christine Sinclair, who at 35 is nearly triple her age. Nine Thorns players will suit up at the women?s World Cup; Olivia hopes to join them in four years. She?s already more famous than some of them. She appeared in a Nike ad during this year?s Oscars and, according to her dad, is regularly stopped for autographs. She has more than 100,000 followers on Instagram, where one of her videos ends, ?I?m not talented. I?m obsessed.?

If you?ve already begun forming an opinion here, you?re not alone. Most people have, for Olivia?s story overlaps with so many broader conversations, from the madness of youth sports to the future of women?s soccer, from gender equity to the never-ending (and ever-subjective) debate about how we should raise our kids and who gets to tell us how to do it. 

Where you come down on these issues, and what Olivia?s groundbreaking path might mean?well, that depends on your perspective.

?Look mate, we understand how this can appear,? says Gavin Wilkinson. It?s 10 a.m. on a recent weekday, and the 45-year-old general manager of the Thorns and MLS?s Timbers has been on the phone trying to wrangle the arrival of Brian Fernandez, from Liga MX in Mexico. A former New Zealand national team defender himself, Wilkinson fires off emails at a standing desk and offers kombucha on tap.

He?s in a unique position. When the NWSL launched in 2013, it endeavored to avoid the mistakes of the two previous pro women?s leagues?poor management, meager investment, lack of a holistic plan. So far, results have been mixed. Average NWSL attendance recently surpassed 6,000 for the first time. Still, some teams play in high school stadiums to sparse crowds. Last summer news stories detailed depressing conditions at the New Jersey?based Sky Blue FC. Port-a-potties for locker rooms. Players cleaning their own jerseys. Unreimbursed medical bills. This is the ?professional? world Carli Lloyd returned to after her World Cup heroics.  

The Thorns are outliers. Under owner Merritt Paulson they operate in concert with the Timbers, sharing training facilities, resources and Providence Park, which just saw an $85 million renovation. Portland wins (two NWSL titles), draws fans (17,000, on average) and turns the league?s largest profit. Paulson treats the franchise as both a business and a passion. A Harvard M.B.A. whose father was secretary of the treasury under George W. Bush, he is a regular, involved presence at the team?s facility, trailed by his dog, Diego. He understands that the Thorns? success is tied to the health of the league, and women?s soccer at large, so it?s in their interest to help domestic competitors. Meanwhile, they worry about overseas threats. The women?s teams of Atl‚tico Madrid and Barcelona drew 60,000 fans for a recent game. Clubs such as Olympique Lyon, in France, offer salaries dwarfing the NWSL?s $46,200 max; last year the Thorns lost two players to Europe. The U.S. has long held women?s soccer preeminence, but that?s changing.

All of which, Wilkinson contends, is important context to consider before you judge his team for taking on a 13-year-old. Yes, it can sound bizarre once you start drawing analogies. Imagine the Warriors inviting a seventh-grade Steph Curry to train at every practice. But maybe, Wilkinson suggests, this is a necessary experiment. ?It?s about changing the perception of the sport,? he says. ?We don?t need to change the perception of the national team?every young girl aspires to be part of that. But there needs to be a stepping stone.? Besides, he says, ?There aren?t too many out there like Olivia.?

So, how good is she? That?s the first question most people ask. And few are better judges of soccer talent than North Carolina women?s coach Anson Dorrance, who?s won 21 NCAA titles and coached 59 future national teamers, including Heath and Mia Hamm.

Dorrance first heard of Olivia in 2017, when she was 11. A coach in California called, said Anson had to see this crazy-good girl. In time he would learn her backstory: how Jessica had been a defender for South Carolina and K.C. had played basketball for NAIA Montana State Northern. How they raised three daughters in Canyon Country, Calif., chronicling vacations and first days of school on a family blog. How in their firstborn they saw glimpses of greatness. (?All of a sudden she is dominating,? Jessica blogged when Olivia was 5. ?She has figured out how to be competitive and sweet!?) How Olivia started playing against boys. How K.C. left his job in pharmaceuticals to focus on Olivia?s development.

At first, though, all Dorrance knew was that she was ?ridiculously young.? Then he watched her at a camp and saw a girl with a preternatural ability to control the ball, read space and create scoring opportunities. Someone who could probably already make his college team. ?A little technical and tactical wizard!? says Dorrance, who believed Olivia had the potential to be ?Tobin Heath?esque.? So he offered her a scholarship, even knowing, as he says, ?we?d be excoriated at every turn.? She accepted. (And he was right.)

The potential payoff was worth it, even if it would be years before Dorrance knew for sure. That?s the thing about banking on a preteen. ?You never know what her final athletic platform is going to look like,? says Dorrance. ?She still has to traverse puberty.?

Think back to 13. Did you have a life plan? A passion?

In 2012, Horan gave up her own UNC offer to play for Paris Saint-Germain. She says she?d do it again??absolutely??but she was also 18 at the time. Would she have been ready to face pros at 13?

?Hell, no. At that age, there?s no way I was ready.?

She?s not alone. ?How would I have fared?? wonders Horan?s U.S. teammate Megan Rapinoe. ?Terrible! I wouldn?t have fared, period. I wasn?t, physically, anywhere near being able to keep up.? Rapinoe wishes Olivia well. She?s rooting for her. But: ?I don?t think she?s anywhere near the level to be on or train with a professional team. I don?t think we?re at a position in women?s soccer to have the systems and structures set up to facilitate the growth of such a young player in the professional environment.?

Abby Wambach, 38, who scored more international goals for the U.S. than any other man or woman, developed faster than most. Still, she says, ?I wasn?t ready at that age.? Then again, she understands the world is changing. ?Who am I to say, ?If I were Olivia, I would go to college?? It?s not my place to judge. It?s my place to create as many opportunities as possible and welcome any unique ways in which players can find their way.?

For the Moultries, college was always the plan. Until Olivia kept improving. The U-14 national team called. Nike and Adidas sent free gear. Spencer Wadsworth, the agent who reps Heath and Horan at Wasserman Media Group, reached out. He?d seen Moultrie?s clips on YouTube?the ones little girls now mimic, of Olivia with the ball magnetized to her feet, launching benders?and so he met with the Moultries. He invited Olivia to pickup games in Playa Vista with Stu Holden and Steve Nash. Like Dorrance, Wadsworth saw a tiny Tobin Heath. And he was all in, despite her age. ?My boss thought I was crazy,? says Wadsworth. ?I was like, You have to see her play, see her mentality. We can push the limits.?

So they did. With Wadsworth?s help, a 12-year-old Olivia spent a week apiece training at Barcelona, Bayern Munich, Lyon and PSG, all clubs that offered the prospect of good money and a first-team debut by 16. That is, if Olivia proved eligible. FIFA stipulates that an international player be 18, unless his or her family can prove they moved for reasons unrelated to soccer. Jessica runs an essential-oils business. They could set up anywhere. It might work.?.?.?. Still, it was a risk.

Another option: the Thorns. Wilkinson and Wadsworth had been talking for a year. Olivia visited and met Portland?s staff, each side evaluating the other. The NWSL, though, presented its own downside. Technically, Olivia couldn?t play or be paid until she was 18. But she could train with some of the world?s best, work out with the Timbers? youth teams and play in friendlies and development academy games.

In February 2019, Olivia gave up her Tar Heels scholarship and college eligibility. She signed a deal with Wasserman and soon after became the youngest female team athlete inked by Nike. According to sources with knowledge of the arrangement, it is an incentive-laden, multiyear contract that includes guaranteed money and could earn Moultrie millions. (Nike declined to comment.) As such, it passes Dorrance?s test: ?I tell girls that if they give up a scholarship, which is worth about $300,000, they need to have an option that is worth more.? 

The announcement made national news. The Thorns and Wadsworth fielded a deluge of interview requests, from GMA to CNN, and turned them down, instructing the Moultries not to speak to the press (they did not make Olivia available for this story), even as the Nike deal and the historic (and public) nature of the Thorns partnership thrust them squarely into the public eye.

For every Michael Phelps and Tara Lipinski, world champions as teens, there exist many more young athletes like Freddy Adu, a soccer phenom who fell short of outsized expectations. Other times the path veers sharply. Marv Marinovich raised his son to be the perfect QB; instead, Todd was out of the NFL by 23, struggling for years with addiction.

None of this is simple cause-and-effect, of course. Every life is messy, complicated. Regardless, once the bar is set, it tends to stay there. ?Extraordinary achievement, though adults have rarely cared to admit it, takes a toll,? writes Ann Hulbert in Off the Charts, her book about child prodigies. ?It demands an intensity that rarely makes kids conventionally popular or socially comfortable.? Such talent can also prove impossible to manage. ?Prodigies offer reminders writ large that children, in the end, flout our best and worst intentions.?

Few can relate to Olivia?s situation as well as Michelle Wie, who in 2000, at age 10, became the youngest golfer to qualify for a USGA amateur championship. ?I didn?t feel like I was 10,? Wie says. ?I was brave, confident.? Two years later she qualified for her first LPGA event and, with much fanfare, began competing against men. At 15 she turned pro, signing a Nike deal. Since then, Wie has won only one major and struggled with injuries. She prefers not to generalize but does offer one bit of advice to Olivia: ?The thing my parents did extremely well was keep everything as normal as possible. Golf was almost secondary.? For Wie that meant private school and, later, college. (She graduated from Stanford.) ?I wanted to be a professional, but they realized there was a whole other side to me as a child. You have to be a well-rounded person.?

She pauses. ?As much as sports seem like everything, they aren?t.?

It?s a warm spring afternoon and the Thorns are practicing at a 24,000-square-foot facility in Beaverton, Ore., near Nike headquarters. Pine and fir trees ring two immaculate fields. Beyond, two-story houses sprout satellite dishes. Swoosh logos are prevalent.

On one pitch players ping a ball to a teammate, get it back, then make a run to beat a defender. It takes a minute to notice Olivia. She blends in for the most part: quick, agile, intense, forever hunched. Tall for 13?she?s 5' 4""?if smaller than an adult. She passes to Sinclair, who?s close to breaking Wambach?s international goals record. ?Yeah, Sinc!? Olivia chirps, the same as her teammates.

It?s all a bit surreal. Consider the Warriors analogy and what this must be like for Sinclair. Hey, KD: Today you?re paired with the seventh-grader.

When the Thorns begin a scrimmage, Olivia sits out. It?s not that she can?t hold her own, coach Mark Parsons later explains??she?s an absolute Energizer bunny who wants to train eight hours a day??but that the team is doing its best to adjust pro periodization schedules to a 13-year-old. ?There?s no blueprint for this.?

It?s been a lot of trial and error. ?Week one she came in like a spitfire. It was like, This 13-year-old is middle of the pack! Then, week two??Parsons makes a whoosh noise??she was clinging for dear life.? So the team adjusted her load. ?And, boom, week three she was back up.?  

Initially the Thorns planned out five weeks for Olivia, then eight. Now they?re at six months. A color-coded team schedule includes an OM tab plotting Olivia?s daily itinerary: practices with the Thorns, games with the U-17 team and so on, with mandatory rest periods, which she hates. The team dedicated one assistant, Rich Gunney, to monitor Olivia and meet with her weekly. She sits with Parsons monthly. Wilkinson huddles with Olivia?s parents every month or two.

In other ways Olivia is treated the same as everyone else. Like all Thorns she wears a GPS tracker during practices and games. Three cameras film her every move in training. Wilkinson can track hydration levels (down to urine density), maximum speed, total distance.?.?.?.?Players have begun wearing sensors in their shorts, for monitoring muscle firing and fatigue.

For now, Olivia is with the team but not of the team. The fact that she can play only in friendlies and preseason games is a point of contention. Wadsworth suggests that no hard-and-fast league rule exists, noting that Adu played at 14 in MLS. NWSL president Amanda Duffy says, though, ?Through our college draft rules and foreign player limits, we do have age restrictions. It?s 18 at the moment.? But she allows this could change. ?We recognize the situation in Portland accelerates the conversation, but we want to make sure we have the right environments for players??reading between the lines: not like Sky Blue FC??if we?re going to start bringing in minors.? It will be interesting to see how it plays out. Some around the Thorns and the Moultries believe she?ll be ready and able to play by 14.

For now, she lives a compartmentalized life. She wakes up, eats a healthy breakfast (her parents limit sugar) and gets in an hour of work on a 50?30-yard backyard turf field. (The Moultries also put in a half-court hoops blacktop for their middle daughter.) Next: schoolwork for a few hours at the kitchen table or her desk, the curriculum set by an independent-study teacher. (Report cards are sent to the team.) By lunch she?s at the facility, eating with Thorns players. She sits in on meetings, goes through practice and, if the team lets her, stays after to do extra work. Then: home, shower and head to one of her sisters? soccer or basketball practices, or maybe work on free kicks for an hour. As for the diversions that consume most 13-year-olds, K.C. says Olivia mainly steers clear. She might watch TV while doing her homework, but mostly she consumes highlights or games. Her social media feed is soccercentric.

Interactions with teammates are limited outside of training, though Horan says she took Olivia out for coffee once. ?I told her to text me if she wanted to get away from her dad or whatever. Then I realized she doesn?t drink coffee, so maybe I brought her to the wrong place.? Like most, Horan praises Olivia?s maturity and focus. ?She?s very confident?not in a bad way, but to be open and have fun. At 13, I was the shyest individual and would never want to step on anyone?s toes or be annoying. People can take it how they want. But certain things about her I think are so cool, because I wish I had that [confidence] at a young age.?

Anyone who?s shepherded a daughter through youth soccer is familiar with the evolution. At first girls run wildly, clumping around the ball, giggling and taking careful note of any passing dogs. (Or maybe that?s just my kids.) For the most part, dads or moms do the coaching. Dandelions and Bumblebees are popular team names, and the postgame snack is of utmost importance. Cartwheels are rampant.

Next: The game takes shape. Passes connect. Faster and bigger kids start to dominate. Wow, it actually looks like soccer out there! Parent-coaches get more serious, or maybe real instructors come in. The best players gravitate to travel teams. Fall through spring, the game provides a steady drumbeat; one practice a week becomes two. Pressure builds to up commitments, to go year-round and choose soccer over other sports. 

Show enough potential and a kid ends up trying out for a program like the Thorns? Development Academy, now in its fourth year. There are analogs all over, a jumble of acronyms?ECNL, ODP?with feeder systems and promises of college showcases, where kids end up in front of someone like Mike Smith, the Thorns? academy director. A fit man with nervy energy, intense eyes and short, gelled hair, Smith asks girls in his opening talk: How many hours per week do you spend with a ball? 

Five, some say. Eight. And so on.

If it really takes 10,000 hours to master something, Smith asks, how many hours do you think that is, from kindergarten to high school senior? As the girls (and parents) fight through the math, Smith answers. Sixteen. And this, he tells them, is the key to success: internal motivation. 

For Olivia, that?s not an issue. Not now. She?s an anomaly, though. The vast majority of girls are more like the seventh-grade daughter of a friend of mine in Portland. She plays soccer and basketball and runs track. She considered trying out for the Development Academy until she learned she?d have to give up hoops. Her father emailed: Couldn?t she do both? The response: Not really; it?s a serious commitment. 

It?s no surprise that kids and parents feel an urgency, heightened by watching the ascent of someone like Olivia. ?It?s comical,? says a parent of one of Moultrie?s U-17 teammates. ?There?s this FOMO. Should I be doing this with my kids? How can we get them there??

Holly Pierce played professionally and now coaches girls in Portland. ?Parents ask me about it,? she says. ? ?Should I be paying for a private coach? Should I build a field in my backyard?? ? She pauses. ?Or they?re looking for me to tell them Olivia?s parents are crazy.? What?s missing, Pierce says, is a focus on the fun. ?I almost feel bad for kids who are earmarked so young.? Wambach agrees, adding that playing high school hoops made her better at soccer, not to mention happier. ?We?re making it harder,? she says, ?for our kids to become fully well-rounded athletes or a fully well-rounded human beings as adults.?

Then there are the odds. ?Ninety-nine percent of kids are not going to be at that level, so what does that do to them?? asks Rapinoe ?Are you just setting them up for failure? I have so many parents asking, ?What can I do to get my kid on the national team?? And this sounds so mean, but I?m like, ?Your kid is 14 and clearly not going to play on the national team. Not ever.? There are 25 women, out of jillions of girls, on the national team. It?s not like you?ve failed if you didn?t make it.? Her voice rises. ?It?s just selfish of these parents. Have a bit of self-awareness and just allow your child to play. There are so many kids out there who are disappointed or feel like they failed. And that?s bulls---.?

The experience is consuming. Elite teams run year-round, require constant travel and can cost as much as $10,000 a year. The justification is the prized college scholarship, but in reality, many are only partial. Over a decade, parents may end up spending more than it?s worth. 

Even then, the path forward in the sport is murky. A list of professions that pay more than women?s soccer would include, well, most professions. The minimum NWSL salary is $16,538. The max is $46,200, but most fall well short of that. The elite few who also make the U.S. national team can earn up to $170,000 or so. That rises for the fortunate handful who, like Olivia, find their way onto the payroll of a Nike or Adidas.

The rest are like Thorns midfielder Celeste Boureille, who discovered soccer at 11, played at Cal and then took an unpaid gig on the Thorns? training team. That isn?t unusual. Because the supply of talented women?s players vastly outstrips demand, and NWSL budgets are threadbare, Portland regularly trains players who aren?t on its roster, in hopes they might develop. (This is essentially what the team is doing with Olivia.) Some prospects stay for years, working as travel agents or teachers on the side.

When Boureille arrived she stayed with a host family in the suburbs. She walked 30 minutes every day to the train, then rode 45 minutes and walked to practice. Eventually, the Thorns offered a roster spot. Elated, she moved into a team apartment, gained access to a shared car and received an entry-level salary?not a living wage but enough to pay the bills. In the offseason she plays in Australia, bringing her annual total earnings to roughly $35,000. For women?s soccer, this qualifies as a success story. It?s also why Olivia?s situation is so unusual and, to some, controversial.

Then again, it wouldn?t be if she were a boy. Then she?d be compared to Alphonso Davies, who played for the Vancouver Whitecaps at 15. Or Michael Owen, who at 12 was courted by the top teams in England, where this type of thing is commonplace. She?d be looking at the MLS minimum of $70,250, so the scholarship question would be moot. If she were a boy, says Pierce, ?We?d be like, He?s amazing!?

But she?s not, which means that every step is more difficult and comes with more scrutiny.

What about the parents? That?s the other unavoidable question with Olivia, even though, really, it?s not specific to the Moultries. They?re just stand-ins for our feelings about when and how to support?or push?our kids. When to make our desires theirs, and vice versa.

?I can only assume her parents are making the best decisions for her,? says Wambach.

?People have opinions,? says Parsons, ?but that?s not your business. That?s their business.?

?I hope she did this on her own,? says Horan. ?I hope parents look at this and know it?s a path and an opportunity, but not to force it.?

Back around Portland, on an unseasonably scorching spring day, soccer parents huddle along the shady sideline of a U-17 Thorns Academy game. Olivia is starting at the number 10 position; she?s the primary offensive playmaker. She is vocal, confident. Early on she beats a defender and drills a shot from 25 yards that goes just high off the crossbar, eliciting oohs from the crowd.

Later she uses a series of ball fakes to beat the same girl?older, larger, tasked with marking the prodigy?and breaks into space. Before Olivia can play a through ball, though, the girl takes her down from behind, a professional foul. Olivia pops up, pissed. ?Leave it!? says the ref, sprinting over and showing the tackler a yellow card. Academy coach Laura Schott is pleased. ?I love that competitive fire!?

Olivia sends a handful of nice balls down the wing and, in the second half, bends a free kick around the wall from 25 yards as the goalie stands frozen. Her third goal in four games is a thing of beauty. Professional-level. But she also flags in the final 15 minutes of each half, her motor slowing. In these moments she transforms back into a kid, tired and hot, watching the world go by, looking like she?d love to jump into a pool. 

Near one end line, back from the action, sit K.C. and Jessica, joined intermittently by their two younger daughters. As parents, they defy some expectations. They are neither loud nor overbearing, which can?t be said for one parent?grandparent? uncle??who spends much of the game at the midline, hollering, berating and generally making an ass of himself.

K.C. wears Nike shorts, a Nike shirt and a Nike hat. He?s built like a point guard 10 years removed from the game. He?s talkative and passionate, whapping my shoulder to make his points. He says he?s heard it all. He?s been compared to Richard Williams and LaVar Ball, which he hates. This isn?t about him, he says. If Olivia were a boy, no one would care about her dad. He?d love for critics to spend a day with his daughter and see how much she loves this, how dedicated she is to her goal. They?d understand that this is her dream, not his. That she isn?t going to open any floodgates, because there?s no one like her. That it?s a matter of when, not if, she becomes the best player in the world.

?In a perfect world, this is going to be this huge win-win for everybody,? K.C. says. ?But she still has to keep improving and prove she can help the team win?not just that she?s the best decision maker or the best technical player. For us, all eyes are on the prize. If she becomes what she wants, then all that matters is that we put her in the best position to succeed. Ultimately, when she steps on the field, that?s all Liv.?

In the months and years to come, the ripples from Olivia?s decision will fan out. Maybe they?ll turn into waves. Maybe they?ll dissipate. Parsons and the Thorns have planned out 12 months ?with the binoculars.? Beyond that? It?s entirely possible Moultrie will never play for Portland. Parsons and Wilkinson are O.K. with this. They view this project as many things: a branding opportunity, a pitch to future talent, a publicity push, a broadside against the European teams and an important test case. Says Parsons, ?We?re going to learn a lot.?

That?s a soccer conversation, though. Listening to everyone weigh in on Moultrie, one can?t help but wonder about the rest of it, like how (and if) this will impact larger ideas about girls, boys and sports. About the value we place on excellence and the cost it incurs. About the tension between what is human?to dream, to be a kid doing cartwheels, to be a good parent, to instill the values that undergird team sports?and the power of external expectations and corporate franchises competing on a global stage. Olivia might say she has a dream, but she?s also a brand.

On this day she?s still 13 and hot and tired. Her game ends tied 2?2. Later she and K.C. will watch the film together, freeze-framing as they go.

Meanwhile, I debrief with my daughters, 10 and 12, and two friends who came along to watch. All of them play soccer, though not in the way Olivia does. Still, they are fascinated by her. You can have a real job at 13?! She plays against Tobin Heath?! She gets free Nike stuff?!

They?re also a bit disappointed by the game. Maybe they expected Olivia to score nine goals or bury a volley from midfield. Maybe they thought it would all be so obvious, a blinking light above her head announcing her awesomeness. But, of course, it wasn?t. It was just a soccer game. And it turned out Olivia?s not superhuman. She?s just a girl.

Like them, but different."

FOUR HOURS BEFORE his final match as a member of the U.S. men's national team, Landon Donovan strolls down a soulless hotel hallway in search of closure. A maid asks if she can clean his room.

""Sure,"" he says. ""I won't be back.""

He has taken this walk to the pregame meal 156 times before. But this October evening feels different. It's more than just knowing he'll soon play with a U.S. crest stitched atop his heart for the last time. The tension also comes from realizing who will be waiting for him when he ends up in the team banquet room: U.S. head coach Jurgen Klinsmann.

The two haven't spoken since the afternoon of May 22, when Klinsmann told Donovan after training that he wouldn't be one of the 23 men representing the United States at the World Cup in June and Donovan told Klinsmann the decision was a mistake. The most decorated U.S. soccer player in history then walked to the dressing room, sat in the shower and cried.LANDON DONOVAN: U.S. SOCCER ICON

GRANTLAND VIDEO SERIES: THE FINISH LINE

Episode 1: Soaking It All In

Episode 2: Chasing Happiness

Episode 3: The Question Remains

It was not the final chapter Donovan had planned. His mom had long told him that when soccer stopped being fun, he should quit. It hadn't been fun for a while. But Donovan had stuck it out and returned to his MLS club, the Los Angeles Galaxy, for one last season, with the ultimate goal of getting himself in the best position to represent his country in a fourth World Cup. His friends and family had bought plane tickets and booked rooms for Brazil, where Donovan imagined his 15-year international career ending on soccer's ultimate stage. But Klinsmann's decision erased all that. To him, Donovan hadn't done enough.

Now, on this October night, Donovan finds himself in Hartford, Connecticut, a misunderstood superstar transformed into a martyr. As he strolls toward the banquet room, he can hear the muted squeals of teenage girls lurking behind a set of lobby doors. He pays no attention, instead plodding on, thinking how, after all of these years, each of these hotels seems the same. The perfectly shaped artificial ferns. The garishly colored carpet. The soft instrumental music humming from speakers above.

When Donovan walks into the banquet room, most of the team is already there, preparing for the night's game against Ecuador. Donovan sets down his bag, walks up to Klinsmann and asks to talk. The coach seems unfazed. In an adjacent hallway, Donovan explains how important it is that the last night of his U.S. career be special. The two men don't agree on what happened this summer. They never will. But tonight it doesn't matter. ""I just want to enjoy this,"" Donovan tells him. ""I want my family to enjoy this.""

Klinsmann listens. Then he tells Donovan he'll be needed in the team meeting room in a few minutes to go over Ecuador. The two shake hands. And they go their separate ways.

""That,"" Donovan would say later, ""was my moment of clarity.""SIX HOURS EARLIER, in the backseat of a soccer-mom minivan, Donovan can't stop singing. For a well-read 32-year-old with an introspective soul and complex view of the world, his taste in music is relatively bubblegum. His favorite band is Boyz II Men. He's friends with the guys from Five for Fighting. And this morning, no matter what Top 40 song is on the radio (right now it's Brit pop band Rixton), he can't help but sing along. ""Me and my broken heart...""

Even on game day, Donovan's schedule is filled with interviews and a news conference. It's yet another example of how this final game is unlike any other. The difference first became apparent the night before, when U.S. Soccer sent a private jet to California to pick up Donovan and 17 of his friends and family members. On the flight, Donovan and his girlfriend, Hannah Bartell, indulged in a glass of Johnnie Walker Black. ""That would have never happened before,"" Donovan admits later. ""Not before a match. But the theme of that match was to enjoy myself.""

Early the next morning, he ate breakfast by himself in the hotel restaurant, his only companion a good-luck text from longtime U.S. teammate DaMarcus Beasley.

When U.S. Soccer president Sunil Gulati first approached Donovan about playing one last time, he wanted no part. He was still bitter about not going to the World Cup. His mother agreed, telling her son she wouldn't go if Klinsmann was the coach. But in time, Donovan changed his mind. ""I didn't want my family's last memory of me on the national team to be something so shitty,"" he says. ""I was hoping to change that.""

He avoided Klinsmann in the lead-up to the match, instead planning details, including when and how long he would play, with Gulati. Still, when an intermediary informed him that Klinsmann wanted to shake hands when he left the field, Donovan was irritated. ""Like we're fucking 6 years old,"" he'd say later. ""You'd think we could just talk about this like men.""

Throughout the day, any time Klinsmann's name comes up, Donovan refuses to let it pass, like a scab he can't stop picking. A fan asks Donovan on Twitter to name the coach who had the biggest impact on his career.

""Tell 'em Jurgen,"" Donovan says to the publicist typing his answers. ""Oh wait, did they mean positive or negative impact?"" He laughs.

ON THE MORNING of May 22, at training camp in Stanford, California, Donovan woke with little clue of how his life would change. The final World Cup roster wasn't due for 11 days. And with a friendly against Azerbaijan on the 27th, he and the other 29 players vying for 23 spots assumed they were safe at least until then. Donovan had entered camp unsure of how he fit in, but after a few sessions, he believed he belonged.

But those inside the team weren't as confident. They remembered Klinsmann's frustration when Donovan elected not to participate in 2011 friendlies against Belgium, France and Slovenia, shortly after Klinsmann took the U.S. job. And although Klinsmann ultimately accepted Donovan's decision to take a four-month sabbatical from the sport in 2012, it came at a critical point during World Cup qualifying. As the foundation of the next U.S. team was being built, Donovan had chosen not to be there.

""By making all those decisions he made for himself, he has to be accountable,"" Klinsmann says. ""And maybe he paid the price.""

In many ways, this is the story of Donovan's career. He had more goals and more assists than anyone else in U.S. history as well as with the MLS. He has played in three World Cups, and in 2010 against Algeria he scored arguably the most iconic goal in U.S. history. Throughout soccer's rise in America from a niche sport to one setting record World Cup TV ratings, the striker was its Madison Avenue poster boy. And on Sunday night against the New England Revolution he has a chance to become the first MLS player to hoist a sixth MLS Cup.

But with success has come struggle. In 2006, when fans turned on him after a poor showing in the World Cup, he felt the ugly side of being a star. He later fought depression and has been under the care of a therapist for years. He went through a divorce with his actress wife, Bianca Kajlich. With time he realized that being happy was more important than scoring goals, no matter what any coach or fan said.

""The reluctant superstar,"" he says. ""That's what my therapist calls me. I was never the guy who was going to give up the rest of my life to do more in the soccer world. I've tried to keep what I think is a healthy balance. I understand some people don't want to see that, they want to see me kill myself to make myself better at soccer, but that's not healthy and that's not me.""

Donovan often clashed with coaches who were paid to squeeze every ounce of talent out of every player. Bruce Arena, who spent a combined 14 years coaching Donovan with the U.S. and the Galaxy, considers Donovan the biggest challenge of his career. As Donovan retires, Arena is one of those wondering if he could have done something different to get more out of him.

""He's sensitive,"" Arena says. ""He often tries to overanalyze things. He doesn't have Michael Jordan DNA or Kobe Bryant DNA. Those guys know their job and compete every day. If it's not the best day, it's not the best day. But they're there, 100 percent mentally and physically. He wasn't always that way. In the last eight years, it's been a coin flip with what to expect from him.""

As Klinsmann was deciding his final roster, he contemplated all of this. Arena told Klinsmann he thought Donovan could help the U.S. In the past, he and former U.S. head coach Bob Bradley had given Donovan the benefit of the doubt, and in the Yanks' biggest moments, he would often deliver. But now, Donovan was admittedly a step slower, and Klinsmann was a different kind of coach. A fiercely competitive striker from Germany, the 50-year-old lacked understanding for a player he thought wasn't responding to the coach's challenges. And the two had history: Klinsmann had coached Donovan during a brief, unsuccessful loan to Bayern Munich in 2009. He also questioned an American soccer culture that deifies young talent too quickly, creating what he sees as a lack of accountability.

""What message do you send to players who are settled in their comfort zone?"" Klinsmann asks. ""Soccer [in the U.S.] is not there yet because these guys are not getting bothered the next day in the market or food shop. In other parts of the world, people come up to you and tell you that you had a bad game. But because Landon got away with it, there was no accountability.""ON MAY 22, Donovan was the last player to walk off the training field when Klinsmann interrupted his path to the locker room.

""Can I talk to you for a minute?"" he asked.

Klinsmann told him that he wasn't part of the group going to Brazil. If someone got hurt, he would be the first person he would call. Donovan told Klinsmann he was making a huge mistake. He added that there were guys on the team who did not always care about the outcome. ""But I do,"" Donovan insisted then. In the locker room, most everyone figured out what was happening. When Donovan entered, he felt their stares. He walked into the shower, sat on the floor and cried. Beasley and Michael Bradley sat next to him.

""You just try to be a friend,"" Bradley says. ""Did we need him? Would we have benefited greatly by having him there? Yes and yes. If it was just about quality or the best guys, there's no doubt he still has the ability to make a difference. But Jurgen didn't see it that way. And Landon didn't give him enough of a reason to change his mind.""

Donovan gathered his belongings and left for the hour flight home to LA. He doesn't recall anything about the trip -- it's a blur. ""I was just trying to make sense of what the hell just happened,"" he says. But he does remember the mocking tweet sent by Klinsmann's then-17-year-old son, Jonathan, that read in part, ""HHAHAHAHA DONOVAN HAHAHAHAA"" and sparked a media firestorm. Jonathan deleted the tweet and allegedly emailed an apology, which Donovan says he never received. Once Donovan arrived back at the Manhattan Beach home he shares with Bartell, he fell into her arms and sobbed. Two days later, Donovan returned to training with the Galaxy. A few weeks later, for the first time since high school, he watched the World Cup on television. ""It was sad,"" he says. ""Not only an ego hit but a hit to my identity. Everything you work for just gone.""THE SECOND DONOVAN steps off the team bus in East Hartford and walks into Rentschler Field for his final match, the cheering and chanting begin. Above him is a massive blue banner that reads, ""LegenD10."" When the game kicks off, the nearly sold-out crowd roars with every Donovan touch. The fans desperately want a goal. Two weeks earlier, fans watched Derek Jeter's walk-off heroics in his final game at Yankee Stadium. Why couldn't Donovan produce some magic of his own?

In the 25th minute, a chance. Forward Jozy Altidore taps a back-heel pass to Donovan 12 yards from the goal. He shoots the ball past the keeper, but it clinks off the right post. He's unable to gather the rebound. He nearly scores on two more chances, but it isn't meant to be. The deafening, defining highlight never comes.

In the 41st minute, Donovan is subbed. With more than 36,000 fans serenading, ""Thank you, Landon,"" he hugs his teammates, hands the captain's band to Altidore and walks off the field. Waiting in front of the U.S. bench is Klinsmann. The two shake hands and briefly embrace. Klinsmann tells Donovan he let him play a few extra minutes in hopes he would score a goal. It's the last time they will talk. At the postgame news conference, Donovan is asked what Klinsmann said during the brief exchange.

""That he should have taken me to Brazil,"" Donovan cracks.

WHEN THE MATCH is over, a 1-1 draw, Donovan stands at midfield watching a video recapping his career. He sees a clip of a 9-year-old Donovan picking up a first-place trophy with his head down. And that's when it all hits him. He remembers how challenging this path has sometimes been. He covers his face with his hands, and the tears fall. After his celebratory lap around the field, he finds his family and friends waiting for him in the tunnel. Donovan walks up to his mom, his twin sister and his girlfriend, and they hug. His body shakes. The more Donovan cries, the more these three women do the same. They too know what was sacrificed to get here. The twin sister who spent her childhood on the sideline, who would text her brother asking when it'd all finally be over. The mother, a teacher who still wishes she would have forced her son to finish high school before letting him chase his professional dreams in Germany. And the girlfriend who was waiting for him in May when he walked into their home broken, humbled and humiliated.

""It was a culmination of everything,"" says his mom, Donna Kenney-Cash. ""It was relief. Pride. Sadness. You could hear him. You could feel him. It got to us.""

Says Donovan: ""I tried so hard to contain myself all night, waiting for that moment that I could get to the three of them so I could really let go. And when I did ... it's just a moment I'll never forget. Those are the three most important women in my life. To experience that with them, I mean, that's real life. That's awesome.""

Some 45 minutes go by before Donovan returns to the dressing room. By then, most of his teammates are understandably gone. He sits in front of his locker and for a moment waits to take off his No. 10 jersey. ""I feel like I was 16 putting this on for the first time just yesterday,"" he says to no one in particular. Then he lifts his arms and pulls the jersey off over his head. One by one, trainers and equipment people stop by and start asking for things. They want his tape. His socks. Something, anything to commemorate the night. Donovan gives nearly all of it away. ""Everything was done,"" he says. ""It was sad.""Donovan's stories for an hour.

""Get used to this,"" agent Richard Motzkin tells his client and friend. ""This is your new life.""

A post-meal Q&A is peppered with the typical ""favorite goal"" and ""favorite match"" questions. In between it all, Donovan reveals that his plans include traveling, spending time with family, pursuing a college degree and maybe coaching. ""Youth soccer,"" he says. ""The pros? I can't deal with the egos."" On this day, there are no jabs at Klinsmann, just a wish to be remembered as more than a soccer player.

""It's not my identity,"" he says, contradicting his words from a few days earlier. ""I'm a human being who happened to be very good at soccer.""

The day before, his head covered by a gray hoodie, Donovan sat in a Dallas hotel bar and try to process everything that's happened since May. To him, it's important that it all makes sense and can be explained. And with each passing day, he gains a clearer understanding of his relationship with Klinsmann.

""I don't think he's malicious, I don't think he's a bad person,"" Donovan says. ""I just think he's very much emotionless in this stuff. For him, he probably hasn't thought about any of this once. And I've agonized over it just about every day since. That's just the way it is.

""Was it personal? Yes. Did it hurt? Yes. It's not like I'm inviting him to dinner any time soon. But it's good to get all this out of the way. We're fine.""

On Sunday, in the MLS Cup, Donovan will take the field for the final time in his professional career. There will be no calls of Landycakes or cries that he never became the overseas star so many had hoped. Instead, win or lose, the final chapter of his career will end with understanding and appreciation from the LA Galaxy fans. In many ways, it's Klinsmann's controversial decision that has ultimately given him his gift of closure.

""I know this is going to sound stupid to a lot of people,"" Donovan says, ""but I'm glad I didn't go. It's good for me to see it's not always going to go your way. I grew a lot more by that happening than by me going to the World Cup. To me, life is about growing as a person. And that's how I've felt about soccer the past few years -- that there was nothing else I could grow from the game. But now I know this was the point all along. I came back so I could go through this. It's all happening the way it's supposed to.""

Just over a month after Russia thumped Saudi Arabia, 5-0, it?s all over. France are champions for the second time, and we?re left to ponder what life will be like without another men?s World Cup match until November 2022. Here are the six biggest lessons from the 2018 World Cup.

1. Defense (and a Ridiculous Amount of Individual Talent) Wins Championships
Yes, they won the final with four goals and sure and they also lit up the scoreboard against Argentina in the round of 16, but the story of France?s World Cup is their defense. I don?t think it?ll be remembered this way, especially given all the goals in the final, but Didier Deschamps?s side is one of the all-time great World Cup defenses. Typically, teams have to trade-off between limiting either the number of chances they concede (like Germany in 2014?playing a high press and possessing a ton of the ball) or the quality of chances (like Italy in 2006?playing everyone behind the ball and ceding possession). But not France: Before the final, only three teams allowed fewer shots per game and only one allowed worse shots (based on expected goals per attempt).

Despite more than a $1 billion worth of talent, Didier Deschamps decided to build a defensive behemoth. Antoine Griezmann, who?s one of the best strikers in the game, functioned as a defense-first advanced midfielder, while Paul Pogba, who was once the most expensive player in the world because of his ability to score and create goals from behind the attack, was employed as a reserved midfielder who rarely got too far forward. And rather than opting for attack-minded fullbacks like Benjamin Mendy and Djibril Sidib‚, Deschamps played two center backs as his fullbacks? Benjamin Pavard and Lucas Hern ndez?for the duration of the tournament.

I was skeptical of his approach from the start. Why trust in your ability to execute on the margins and shut out the opposition when you can overwhelm them with a potentially devastating super-charged attack? Well, because it?s enough to win you the goddamn World Cup.

Despite the conservative setup, France still had match-winning attacking talent, and when your opponents can?t score, one moment or two moments of brilliance means more than it usually does. Pogba won the games against Australia and Peru with a handful of plays from midfield. Kylian Mbapp‚ napalmed Argentina?s decrepit defense. Rapha‰l Varane and Samuel Umtiti, arguably the two best center backs on the planet, headed in the winners against Uruguay and Belgium. And then, after a fortunate first half that saw France score a hyper-efficient two goals on one total shot, Pogba did all of this:

And then Mbapp‚ did that:

The most impressive thing about this team is how everyone seemed to buy in. This, after all, is the same nation that saw its 2010 World Cup brought down by a player mutiny. Although N?Golo Kant‚ didn?t have a great final, he might?ve been the best player in Russia during the past month. By fighting back their natural tendencies, Pogba and Griezmann allowed Kant‚ to roam the field and win the ball back, and he led all players in tackles plus interceptions. Rather than defensive stalwart Kant‚ doing the dirty work and letting Pogba and Griezmann run free, it was the big-name stars who sublimated their games. When a handful of Belgium players criticized the French approach after their semifinal?despite, uh, getting outshot 19-9?Griezmann responded: ?I don?t care. I want the star [on my shirt for World Cup winners]. If I get that star, I don?t care about how we play.?

An indomitable defense like France?s just doesn?t work if the players and the manager aren?t on the same page. The 24 of them were, and now they?re all legends forever.

Because of the defensive-minded tactical setup, the French public never really warmed to the national team before the final. One nurse, who called into a local radio station, summed up the nationwide feeling: ?Deschamps has a Ferrari in his hands and never breaks the speed limit!? I can?t imagine she still feels the same way. After all, it doesn?t matter how fast you?re going as long as you cross the finish line first.

2. Underdogs: Get Yourself a World-Class Midfield
While the team never quite optimized their approach, the midfield of Luka Modric, Ivan Rakitic, and Marcelo Brozovic kept Croatia in every game. The team attempted an incredible 68 crosses between the semifinal and the final. That?s not the efficient way to score, but they were able to bomb balls into the box only because the guys in the middle won the game of keep-away when it mattered.

Croatia, who came into the tournament with just a 7 percent chance of making the final, according to FiveThirtyEight, certainly benefited from being on the easy side of the draw, as they didn?t play a group winner in the knockout stages until the final. And as it stands, they still haven?t won a tournament-elimination game in regulation since ? 1998. But despite playing an extra 90 minutes across the playoffs, they took the game to France. Brozovic completed more passes than France?s entire midfield?Pogba, Kant‚, Steven N?Zonzi, and Blaise Matuidi?combined. And not even Kant‚, the best defensive midfielder in the world, could quite handle Croatia?s midfield dominance as he picked up a yellow in the first half and came off early in the second.

France as a whole completed just 27 passes in the final third across 90 minutes, while Modric and Rakitic alone exceeded that number:

Although one of their goals came on a baffling error from Hugo Lloris when the game was pretty much over, most of the bounces didn?t go Croatia?s way in the final?from the own goal to the penalty to the two incredible finishes from Pogba and Mbapp‚. And so 4-2 really just doesn?t feel like an accurate representation of what happened. Knockout soccer is the cruelest version of an already unforgiving sport. But you can control only what you can control, and Croatia?s midfield made sure it at least did that.

I don?t know if Modric was the best player in Russia. Personally, I?d have given the Golden Ball to Pogba?this team doesn?t click without him doing the defensive work and then springing the attack forward?but I can?t get too worked up over it. The award has always been more about affirming a narrative anyway, and an always underappreciated superstar finally picking up an individual honor in the twilight of his career does just that. Croatia?s World Cup was a testament to just how far a team could go by keeping things close in every match. Their at-times dominant midfielders allowed them to do that, and Modric is the best midfielder the country has ever produced.

3. It?s a Young Man?s Game
Want an easy explanation for why none of Brazil, Germany, or Argentina made the semifinals for the first time ever? They were too old. Along with Spain, those sides all brought aging squads to Russia and paid for it. The peak age for a professional varies by position but it?s typically in the 24 to 28 range. Half of Brazil?s starting XI were beyond peak age, and almost all of Argentina, Spain, and Germany?s key players were beyond that benchmark, too.

Meanwhile, the heavyweight battle of the semifinals between France and Belgium featured two teams with most of their key players either smack-dab in the middle of their primes or not even there yet:

The same goes for England. Here?s what the current squad looks like?four years from now:

Mark Taylor
The rule even kind of applies to Croatia: While their stars, Modric, Rakitic, and Mario Mandzukic are all on the wrong side of 30, manager Zlatko Dalic still gave about 50 percent of his team?s minutes to peak-age players.

Overall, it seems like national-team managers need to be a little less sentimental with their squad choices and trust in the talent coming up behind. (The United States might?ve made it to Russia if they?d heeded this advice, too.) With most teams demanding constant motion and sizable defensive and offensive output from their players, the sport is just so hard to play now.

?The physical demands of soccer have changed so noticeably in the last decade that it?s hard to see how we won?t see a continuation of a trend toward younger teams,? Chris Anderson, author of The Numbers Game, told me. ?We?re already seeing it in the top leagues?the game is so fast and so dynamic and the physical demands so high, it?s really hard for older guys to keep up.?

4. VAR Killed the Red Card
Even when he misses, Cristiano Ronaldo makes history. The 33-year-old Juventus superstar?man, that?s gonna take a while to get used to?couldn?t beat Iran?s Alireza Beiranvand, but his spot kick broke the record for most penalties at a World Cup ? with three days left in the group stage. That was number 19, and since then, the number has ballooned to 29. All hail VAR.

Despite awarding this tournament to an openly homophobic plutocracy with an extremely-dubious-at-best history of doping, FIFA did get VAR right. I was skeptical of the value of introducing brand-new technology into such a delicate sporting event that happens just once every four years, and the early flurry of penalties seems to suggest that defenders hadn?t adjusted their games to the added scrutiny. And while the VAR penalty awarded to France in the first half of the final seemed to push the eventual champions over the edge, there were only four spot kicks awarded during the knockout stages.

But more importantly, VAR seems like it?s decimated the kind of strategic violence that often defines a handful of games at each World Cup. These numbers remained the same through Sunday?s final:

It cleaned up dirty play and possibly opened up things for attackers. Despite an early flurry of set-piece goals, the percentage of goals scored on set pieces was up by about just 4 percent, but VAR seems to have shaken things open for teams that spend time training corner kicks. The 26 goals from corners during this tournament is the most since 1966.

?VAR?s cleaned up corners and made them a significant attacking threat,? Mark Taylor, an analyst who works with Premier League clubs, said. ?They were always more valuable to some sides than was widely acknowledged. It should favor the attackers, just as 1998 put an end to the tackle from behind.?

If VAR ultimately leads to more goal scoring and cuts down on in-game violence, then it?s a clear win. And if that, in turn, puts an end to the quadrennial whining about players diving too much, then whoever developed the technology deserves serious Nobel Prize consideration.

While not all of the major European leagues are using it yet, the World Cup should also make it easy for all of them to implement VAR without much blowback. Part of what has made soccer such a long-lasting international behemoth is its simplicity: 22 players, only two can use their hands; don?t foul; don?t kick the ball out of bounds; don?t be offside; and that?s it. But as players and strategies continue to evolve, so can the game. Next up: It might be time to reassess the shape of the 18-yard box.

5. Managers Matter More Than Ever Before
Before the World Cup, Soccernomics coauthor Simon Kuper told me, ?The manager?s role is usually vastly overrated.? The players on the field win and lose and draw the games, and at the club level, the quality of those players is typically determined by how rich your team is. The best teams seem like they have the best managers because they have the best players.

However, it?s not quite that simple?especially when it comes to the international game, when rosters are determined by whatever players or players? relatives happen to be born in a given country. Just look at the teams in the final: Deschamps won the World Cup with a well-drilled defense, and Dalic, who didn?t become Croatia?s manager until October 2017, helped smooth out a team that sputtered through World Cup qualifying.

?In the Premier League, for example, there is an obsession with managers, but when it comes to international games, they are only a small part of the discussion,? Omar Chaudhuri, head of football intelligence at the consultancy 21st Club, said. ?Which is odd because it feels like coaching is even more important in international football.?

Iran came into the tournament without one player who plays in any of Europe?s top five leagues, and yet they were a goal away from advancing out of a group that included the past two European champions and a talented Morocco side. Meanwhile, Sweden were without the best player in the country?s history and possibly even still their best player right now, and they won a group that included the defending World Cup champs and then advanced farther than Spain, Portugal, and Argentina.

?I felt like when you looked at some of the smaller nations, you could tell who were the ones who had been coached really well, and those that hadn?t been,? Chaudhuri said. ?All the players knew their roles and were able to execute them despite technical deficiencies.?

Then there was England. While they generally struggled from open play, the Three Lions made the semifinals of the freaking World Cup and were less than 30 minutes away from the final. Gareth Southgate had difficulty with his in-game adjustments, but for the most part, his team tried to pass its way out of dangerous situations. They played a unique tactical system with really only one true midfielder, and they were dominant from set plays.

?Southgate knows the difference between what can and should be practiced and drilled, and what should be left to the players to decide. E.g., set pieces and especially penalties are standardized routines which can be practiced,? Garry Gelade, a former analyst with Chelsea, said. ?Hopefully, the insanity ?you can?t practice penalties? is now consigned to the dustbin of history, while the players are given freedom to express themselves and improvise in attacking situations.?

On the other side of the coin: Spain. You may remember ? that they fired their manager a day before the tournament started! Before leaving for Real Madrid, Julen Lopetegui had turned Spain into a devastating possession machine that scored 36 goals and conceded just three in 10 qualifying matches. They were unlucky to lose to Russia, but despite completing a still mind-boggling 1,008 passes to their opponents? 192 (!), Spain barely created any dangerous opportunities until the final period of extra time. Without any direction going forward, they fell back on their ability to pass it around.

?When Lopetegui left, there was no movement on their price on Betfair,? Chaudhuri said, ?but when push came to shove against Russia, they were hopelessly short of ideas.?

6. Random Rules
France seemed to plow its way through this World Cup like a nuclear icebreaker?never moving too quickly, but always fast enough to shatter all of their brittle opponents. However, the feeling of seeing them lift the trophy undersells just how close they were to going home a few weeks ago. Per 21st Club?s probability models, France had an 81 percent of being eliminated when they were down 2-1 in the 56th minute against Argentina?only to be saved by Benjamin Pavard?s artful volley. Meanwhile, Croatia, who also needed two penalty-shoot-out wins to even reach the semis, were down 1-0 against England with 23 minutes remaining and just a nine percent chance of advancing. And in the final, well, Croatia fans are gonna be rueing this one for a long, long time:

Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight?s three pretournament favorites?Brazil, Germany, and Spain?were given a 49 percent chance of winning the whole thing between them and were all eliminated before the semifinals. All three sides can feel unfortunate to varying degrees?Germany were at least probably as good as the three other teams in their group; Spain got knocked out in a game in which they gave up one shot on target; Brazil outshot Belgium 27 to 9 in their quarterfinal loss?but that?s the beauty of international soccer. Anything can happen in one game or three games or seven games. Thanks to improvements in coaching and player training across the globe, it seems like the rest of the world is starting to catch up to the traditional powers. The middle class is at least now close enough that the difference in player quality doesn?t matter as much in such a compressed format.

In many ways, club soccer is better than it?s ever been, as almost all of the top teams now employ frenetic, progressive styles of play that hunt out high-quality chances. But at the same time, it?s become a little too predictable: Juventus have won the last seven Serie A titles, Bayern Munich have won six in a row in Germany, PSG have won five of the last six in France, Barcelona have won three of the last four in Spain, and in the Premier League, the one league that is supposed to promise uncertainty, Manchester City just won by 19 points.

With the international game, the quality of play still isn?t close: The teams that tried to employ aggressive possession-based approaches, Spain and Germany, went home early, while the defining feature of this France team is avoiding the temptation of playing too many of their top attackers and instead favoring an organized, conservative approach.

But that didn?t really matter this summer. There was something so refreshing and so thrilling about sitting down each morning and not having any clue about what might play out. For that reason, I don?t think it?s a clich‚ to say it: The 2018 World Cup was the best of my lifetime."
https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/how-to-enjoy-soccer,y,"I was five years old when I first heard the word ?soccer.? My best friend and I were changing into our fresh-out-of-the-box uniforms in his Mom?s station wagon, and I figured that the name of this sport we were about to try must have something to do with the long purple socks that we were trying to pull on over what we?d just learned were called shin guards.

A year later, once I?d learned to spell, I was baffled to see that the name of my favorite sport wasn?t ?socker.? And so, the first soccer game I ever saw was the first game I played in. I probably scored a goal, too. I usually did. Not to brag, but as a five-year-old kid on the sun-scorched fields of North Texas, wearing a perforated purple jersey that hung down to my knees, I was an absolute menace in front of goal. This was in the mid-seventies, in the middle of the big U.S. soccer boom. The original North American Soccer League had just formed. I was a Dallas Tornado fan. I saw them play the New York Cosmos with Pel‚ and Beckenbauer in the squad. I had a poster of Kyle Rote, Jr., on my wall. It seemed like every kid in America was playing soccer, even the girls. And the best of those little girls, who grew up playing right alongside the boys, went on to form the incredibly dominant first generation of the U.S. women?s national soccer team. I enjoy thinking that I had something to do with that.

That?s how it started for me, and I haven?t stopped playing, watching, and loving soccer since. But that?s just me?oh, and about a gazillion other people around the world, and even one or two hundred in the United States. That?s a joke. Despite the running gag that ?Amuricans hate soccer,? there are plenty of soccer fans in America, and most of us don?t care whether you want to join us or not. Just don?t tell us that soccer is boring because, believe it or not, that?s not a very interesting thing to say. For the rest of you, the interested and interesting folks out there who might not know much about the game but want to enjoy it a little more during this World Cup, here are a few tips.

Pick a team.

Life?s more fun when you have a dog in the race, so make a bracket. Place a friendly bet. Pick a team to go all the way, or just choose your side match to match. I like rooting for the underdog. Don?t know who the underdog is? America from here on out is an underdog.

Do the minimal research.

You are just five minutes on the Internet away from understanding the offside rule and how it affects the game. That?s the only tricky one. Another five minutes and you?ll know the next matchups, which teams are favorites, who has injuries, and even what their girlfriends look like if that?s your bag.

Don?t be a ball watcher.

If two players are a leg?s length from the ball, there are twenty others playing the game elsewhere on the field, and everything they do affects everything else. Soccer is a complex, ever-flowing chess game with running. Get into it. See how the movements of a player?s teammates give him passing opportunities or open up new space for him to dribble. What choices does he make? On defense, notice how the positioning of a single player a couple yards in any direction changes the team?s defensive ?shape? and either closes down space or opens it up.

Enjoy the sociocultural anthropology of it all.

Pay attention to the rising and falling of individual and team confidence, the turning of momentum, the clashing of wills. Consider the delicate balance of a team?s commitment to offense or defense in terms of risk versus reward. Notice how countries and even continents play the game differently?I find that part endlessly fascinating.

Finally, and most important?

Appreciate what?s happening.

Don?t let the wide camera angles lull you into missing the physicality of it. It?s easy to start thinking that it?s perfectly reasonable for a kicked ball to go exactly where the player intended, or that a ball flying fifty yards through the air should by all logic settle down nice and easy on the toe of a person?s foot, but remember that a soccer ball is an inanimate object. Almost everything you?re seeing these players do with it has taken hours and hours, even years, to perfect. It?s like watching a constant stream of magic tricks. Enjoy that. Clap right there on the couch if you want to. That?s what I do.

Now, as many have said, it?s hard to truly appreciate this stuff if you?ve never played before, but if you haven?t, try this. Imagine you?re running as fast as you can. I mean a full-on panting sprint. Now imagine doing something else with your feet at the same time. Seriously, imagine it. It?s hard to wrap your head around the idea, isn?t it? Now imagine there?s another human trying his best to stop you. Imagine that other human is a brawny Brazilian nicknamed Hulk. When you start to see it that way, you realize that soccer isn?t all about the goals. It?s about all the amazing little things that happen along the way. That?s why Pel‚ called it the beautiful game. And because he called it that, I got picked on a lot as a kid."
https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/fbi-accuses-wealthy-parents-including-celebrities-in-college-entrance-bribery-scheme/2019/03/12/d91c9942-44d1-11e9-8aab-95b8d80a1e4f_story.html,n,"The Justice Department on Tuesday charged 50 people ? including two television stars ? with participating in a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme that enabled privileged students with lackluster grades to attend prestigious colleges and universities.

The allegations included cheating on entrance exams and bribing college officials to say certain students were athletic recruits when those students were not in fact athletes, officials said. Numerous schools were targeted, including Georgetown University, Yale University, Stanford University, the University of Texas, the University of Southern California and UCLA, among others.

[Read the affidavit: FBI charges 50 in college admissions bribery scheme]

In Boston, U.S. Attorney Andrew Lelling called it the largest-ever college admissions scam prosecuted by the Justice Department. Of the 50 people charged in the FBI?s Operation Varsity Blues, 33 were parents, officials said, warning that the investigation is ongoing and that others could be charged.

The scheme was discovered accidentally by the FBI while working an unrelated undercover operation about a year ago, officials said. That tip led to a sprawling, nationwide corruption probe.

?These parents are a catalogue of wealth and privilege,? said Lelling. ?This case is about the widening corruption of elite college admissions through the steady application of wealth combined with fraud. There can be no separate college admission system for the wealthy, and I?ll add there will not be a separate criminal-justice system, either.?

No students were charged because prosecutors said their parents were the scheme?s principal actors.

Court filings released Tuesday paint an ugly picture of privileged parents committing crimes to get their children into selective schools otherwise unlikely to accept them.

Among those charged are actresses Felicity Huffman, best known for her role on the television show ?Desperate Housewives,? and Lori Loughlin, who appeared on ?Full House.? A representative for Loughlin declined to comment. A representative for Huffman did not return messages seeking comment. Huffman appeared in federal court in Los Angeles on Tuesday and was released on $250,000 bond.

Others arrested Tuesday include a private-equity executive in Northern California, a senior lawyer at a major law firm in New York and a public relations executive in Los Angeles. Prosecutors said they took part in a criminal conspiracy to bribe test officials and college sports officials.

In the wake of the charges, universities began firing or placing on leave some of the accused coaches.

The scheme?s chief architect, William Singer, pleaded guilty in federal court Tuesday. Officials described Singer as a well-connected college admissions adviser and say he disguised the bribery scheme as a charity, enabling parents to deduct the bribes from their taxes.

Singer was charged with taking about $25 million from 2011 to 2018 ? paying some of it to college coaches or standardized-testing officials for their help rigging the admissions process and pocketing the rest, according to the criminal complaint. He allegedly disguised the money using a nonprofit, the Key Worldwide Foundation, which prosecutors described as a slush fund for bribes.

Singer pleaded guilty Tuesday to conspiracy charges for racketeering, money laundering and obstruction of justice. He had been cooperating since September. Prosecutors said that a month after he came to the government?s side, Singer alerted several people under investigation about the inquiry ? which earned him the obstruction charge. Lawyers for Singer did not respond to requests for comment.

Another defendant is Gordon Caplan, co-chairman of the international law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. Neither Caplan nor his firm immediately responded to requests for comment.

Court papers charge that in one secretly recorded conversation, Caplan asked Singer: ?If somebody catches this, what happens??

?The only one who can catch it is if you guys tell somebody,? Singer replied.

?I?m not going to tell anybody,? Caplan said, and the two men laughed, according to the court papers.

Two California parents paid Singer in the form of Facebook stock ? 2,150 shares worth $251,159 at the time of the bribe in July 2016, according to court papers. Those parents claimed that payment as a charitable donation, the papers said.

Early in the investigation, the FBI was able to flip Yale?s former women?s soccer coach, who provided evidence against others, officials said. Rudolph Meredith pleaded guilty nearly a year ago, after prosecutors gathered evidence he took a $400,000 bribe to pretend that one prospective student was a recruit, despite the fact that the student in question did not play competitive soccer. The student?s parents paid $1.2 million in bribes, officials said.

Yale?s president, Peter Salovey, sent a letter to the Yale community calling the allegations ?an affront to our university?s deeply held values of inclusion and fairness. I want to assure our community,? it says, ?that I am committed to making certain the integrity of the admissions and athletic recruitment processes is not undermined again. As the investigation unfolds, the university may take further actions.?

Prosecutors also charged Georgetown?s former head tennis coach, Gordon Ernst. Authorities said he made $950,000 promoting several students as potential tennis recruits ? when they were not tennis players of that caliber.

For example, prosecutors alleged, Ernst flagged a California couple?s daughter as a ?potential spot,? and her application falsely indicated she had played club tennis through high school and achieved a Top 50 ranking in the U.S. Tennis Association?s junior girls category from her sophomore through her senior years. In fact, she had not played at any Tennis Association tournaments in high school, officials said.

?At her best,? prosecutors wrote, ?she appears to have ranked 207th in Northern California in the under-12 girls division, with an overall win/loss record of 2-8.?

In a statement, Georgetown said the school was ?deeply disappointed? to learn of the criminal charges against Ernst and said he ?has not coached our tennis team since December 2017, following an internal investigation that found he had violated University rules concerning admissions. Georgetown cooperated fully with the government?s investigation.?

After leaving Georgetown, Ernst was hired as the University of Rhode Island?s tennis coach. The school said Tuesday he had been placed on administrative leave.

Loughlin and her husband, fashion designer Mossimo Giannulli, were accused of paying $500,000 in bribes so their two daughters would be designated as recruits for the University of Southern California rowing team ? even though they were not part of the team. That helped the pair get into USC, according to the complaint.

Some of the money was directed to Donna Heinel, a USC athletics official, the complaint alleges. In a statement, USC officials said the school is cooperating with the federal investigation and has launched its own review.

Jovan Vavic, the former water polo coach at USC, was charged with taking bribes to pretend students flagged by Singer were recruits for the team. Prosecutors alleged Singer paid private-school tuition payments for Vavic?s children, under the guise of a fabricated scholarship. Vavic did not return an email seeking comment.

USC said Tuesday that Heinel and Vavic had been fired.

?We understand that the government believes that illegal activity was carried out by individuals who went to great lengths to conceal their actions from the university,? the statement says. ?USC is conducting an internal investigation and will take employment actions as appropriate .?.?. the university is reviewing its admissions processes broadly to ensure that such actions do not occur going forward.?

Besides fake athletic credentials, the other main thrust of Singer?s schemes involved cheating on college entrance exams. Sometimes that was done by paying a 36-year-old Florida man, Mark Riddell, to take the tests for students. Riddell was so proficient at the exams that he could get a perfect score or calibrate his answers to get very high marks but not a perfect score, the U.S. attorney said. Riddell also agreed to plead guilty in the case and cooperate with investigators, according to officials. Riddell did not immediately return messages, and no attorney was listed for him in court records.

Other defendants are accused of bribing college entrance exam administrators to facilitate cheating ? in some cases, providing students with answers to exams or correcting their answers after they had completed the exams, according to the criminal complaint filed in federal court.

Prosecutors said a key element of the test-cheating scheme was to make arrangements for the tests to be administered privately over a two-day period, making it easier for Riddell stand in for the students or for a corrupt test administrator to fix the answers.

Huffman is accused of paying $15,000 ? disguised as a charitable donation ? to the Key Worldwide Foundation so her oldest daughter could participate in the scam. A confidential informant told investigators that he advised Huffman that he could arrange for a third party to correct her daughter?s answers on the SAT after she took it. She ended up scoring a 1420 ? 400 points higher than she had gotten on a PSAT taken a year earlier, according to court documents.

Huffman also contemplated running a similar scam to help her younger daughter but ultimately did not pursue it, the complaint alleges.

Other defendants include William McGlashan, a senior executive at a global private-equity firm, TPG Growth, which is a major investor in the ride-hailing service Uber and the music-streaming app Spotify.

A TPG spokesman said that ?as a result of the charges of personal misconduct against Bill McGlashan,? he has been placed on ?indefinite administrative leave effective immediately.?

According to the criminal charges against McGlashan, he and Singer agreed to trick admissions officials at USC into believing McGlashan?s son was a kicker for a football team ? even though his high school didn?t have a football team. Singer offered to edit an image of the child?s head onto a photo of a football kicker, officials alleged. As they discussed it, McGlashan said the situation was ?pretty funny,? court documents say. ?The way the world works these days is unbelievable.?

https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/the-tragedy-of-diego-maradona-one-of-soccers-greatest-stars,n,"On November 10, 2001, Diego Armando Maradona played his final testimonial match, in Buenos Aires. For those unacquainted with the tradition, testimonials are tribute games, played for adoring, nostalgic fans, in which friends of the honored player jog leisurely around the pitch, allowing him one more moment of glory. Maradona?s testimonial was an all-star affair, with luminaries like Hristo Stoichkov and Eric Cantona, befitting a player who was once regarded as the best in the world. In his prime, Maradona could flit past defenders with sublime ease, but now, at forty-one, he was overweight, with bad knees and bad ankles, and had been fighting drug addiction for nearly two decades. The opposing players indulged him, stepping aside as he lumbered by. He scored two goals that day, both penalties against Ren‚ Higuita, the former goalkeeper for the Colombian national team, who obliged his old friend by jumping out of the way. Each time the ball hit the back of the net, Higuita and Maradona locked in an embrace.

For casual fans, it made for uncomfortable viewing. Even for those of us who knew the broad outlines of Maradona?s fall from grace, it was shocking. In the nineteen-eighties, when I was in middle school, Maradona had been my idol, but, by the time of the testimonial match, I admit that I?d lost sight of his career. It was harder to keep up with world soccer in those days, but that?s only a partial excuse. This, unfortunately, is how we often treat our heroes: with a kind of transactional love. We use them up. Seeing him in that tribute game was a reminder of all we?d taken from him, and I wasn?t the only one who felt that way. A few days later, in Lima, Peru, I visited a cousin of mine. At the mention of Maradona?s farewell match, he fell into a reverential silence, his eyes suddenly watering. ?Diego is going to die,? he said in an urgent whisper, the words tumbling out with the force of discovery, as if Maradona?s mortality had never occurred to him. My cousin was in medical school at the time.

If it seems strange to you that a med student could forget that another human being was subject to the same laws of life and death as the rest of us, it?s likely you didn?t see?perhaps ?experience? is the correct verb?Maradona at his peak. Argentina?s quarter-final match against England in the 1986 World Cup will always be remembered for Maradona?s two goals, which, taken together, are a kind of shorthand into his genius and recklessness. The first, an audacious handball, is brazen, opportunistic cheating?which somehow worked. His second, scored minutes later, is known simply as the Goal of the Century: a dazzling, mazy seventy-yard sprint with the ball glued improbably to his left foot, as English defenders flail helplessly to the side. The iconic Argentine-television narration sums up the feeling: ?Diego,? the breathless announcer shouts, ?what planet are you from??

Somehow, between scoring that goal, winning the World Cup two matches later, and that 2001 testimonial match, it all went wrong. Asif Kapadia?s remarkable new documentary, called simply ?Diego Maradona? and released, in September, on HBO, tells the harrowing story of what happened. The film, like all good sports documentaries, is only ostensibly about sport: in fact, it?s a tragic parable, a portrait of genius, a revealing look at the emotional cost of fame and how disposable talent can be, no matter how otherworldly the gift. What the film makes clear is that the origins of Maradona?s downfall were always present; the bold recklessness that made him successful also crippled him in the end.

Maradona grew up in Villa Fiorito, a slum on the outskirts of Buenos Aires. Raised in poverty, he signed his first professional contract at age fifteen, and supported his family from that day forward. At twenty-one, he joined F.C. Barcelona, for what was then a world-record fee. The film?s first shocking sequence comes from the tail end of his time there: a young Maradona in an on-field brawl, wading fearlessly into the thick of the chaos. It was the final of the Copa del Rey, played before the King of Spain, though these sporting details hardly matter. This isn?t soccer we?re watching; it?s a street fight. A quick cut takes us to the end of the incident: Maradona, panting, his blue-and-red jersey torn at the neck, and, behind him, a glimpse of the stadium, the faceless thousands who?ve just witnessed this madness. He seems not to notice them.

The documentary really begins in July, 1984, when Barcelona sold Maradona to Napoli (for another world-record fee), and eighty-five thousand fans packed the Stadio San Paolo to welcome him. Nothing about the sale made sense: one of the world?s greatest players (he was not yet the greatest) sold to a club in Italy?s poorest and most violent city, a team more accustomed to fighting relegation than vying for trophies. The illogic is hinted at in the first press conference, when an impudent journalist dares to ask what many must have wondered: Did the local Mafia have anything to do with financing this deal? Maradona, young and handsome, dissembles for a moment, before the president of the club, Corrado Ferlaino, steps in to reject the notion with full-throated anger. In spite of these denials, the spectre of the Camorra haunts the film, always present, dark and seductive.

The film argues convincingly that Maradona?s greatest sporting achievement was not the 1986 World Cup victory with Argentina but the two scudettos?Italian domestic-league championships?that he won with Napoli, in 1987 and 1990, which upended the league and angered the traditional powerhouses. The vitriol directed at Napoli and its fans was an expression of a national divide between the North and South. Naples was thought of as backward, barely part of Italy at all but, in the words of one commentator, ?African,? a statement that reveals some of the racism that still plagues soccer today. During Napoli?s match against Juventus, in Turin, the fans sang, ?Sick with cholera! Victims of the earthquake! You never washed with soap! Napoli shit! Napoli cholera! You?re the shame of Italy!? An underdog from a slum, Maradona took this classism personally. Later in the film, we see him at home with his young daughter, still in diapers. She has a microphone in her hand and he?s coaching her: ?Juventus, vaffanculo!? he says??Juventus, fuck off??delighting as she repeats it. This scene approaches the essence of his gift. It wasn?t simply athletic; it was in his character, his defiance.

The on-field footage is stunning, but it?s the smaller, more intimate moments that really stand out: we see a young Maradona playing tennis with his girlfriend; relaxing at a family barbecue; leading his teammates in fight songs; lost in his thoughts as a party rages around him. Fans gather at his doorstep, begging for autographs and photos, though it doesn?t seem to gratify him. To be famous is to be condemned to a unique variety of loneliness. Nevertheless, the Neapolitans, who can scarcely comprehend their good fortune?it?s as if their city has been visited by an angel in soccer cleats?shower him with manic adulation. A nurse leaves a vial of Maradona?s blood on a shrine in a Catholic church. When Napoli wins its first title, a banner is hung along a wall at the entrance to a cemetery, taunting the dead: ?You don?t know what you missed.?

In a sense, we all missed it: not what happened on the field but Maradona?s decline, which took place away from the fans. Now, with this film, it?s all there, right before our eyes. As the fame wears on him, he puts on a little weight. We see him with a local mafioso, going out for the night. He describes his routine: after the weekly game, on Sunday, he parties until Wednesday, with cocaine provided by his Mafia friends; he takes a few days to dry out; he plays again; he repeats. It all seems so joyless. After leading Napoli to its first (and, for now, only) European club title, in 1989, Maradona asks to be transferred. He is spent, and descending into full-blown addiction. Ferlaino, Napoli?s president, says no. ?I became his jailer,? Ferlaino admits.

The defining moment came during the 1990 World Cup, in Italy. Maradona, playing for Argentina and already hated by most Italian fans because of his association with a despised club, was booed everywhere he played. Argentina met Italy in the semifinals, at Napoli?s Stadio San Paolo. For Maradona, it was a kind of homecoming to a city ridiculed by the rest of Italy, so he invited local fans to support Argentina instead. This was perceived by many as disrespect, and, when Argentina eliminated Italy, Maradona became the most hated man in the country. The next season, back at Napoli, he faced fury unlike any he?d ever encountered. Now unloved, his partying spun out of control. Soon afterward, he was caught in a doping-and-prostitution scandal, the league banned him from the game for more than a year, and he returned to Argentina in disgrace.

What?s remarkable isn?t the scale of Maradona?s precipitous fall but the fact that he kept it together for so long, under such intense pressure. Watching the film, we get a sense of what might have been if this supremely gifted athlete had been protected, just a bit, from the demands of fame, and from himself. The day of his 2001 testimonial, Maradona took the microphone and stood before the crowd, arms folded across his chest, as they sang his name. Soccer is the world?s most beautiful game, he said, and nothing he?d done should be held against the sport itself. ?I made mistakes, and I paid for them,? he said. The entire stadium roared back its forgiveness, and he paused for a second, before continuing. ?But the ball is never stained.?

https://www.theringer.com/2017/10/11/16457626/soccer-world-cup-2018-us-qualifying-bruce-arena-christian-pulisic-future,y,"After such a disastrous qualifying campaign, the U.S. has to start thinking ahead to 2022. The present still feels like a nightmare, but the future looks better than it ever has.In the end, only Michael Bradley was left in the bowels of Ato Boldon Stadium in Couva, Trinidad and Tobago. His teammates were gone, shattered after a 2-1 loss that, combined with last-minute wins by Panama and Honduras, meant that the United States men?s national team will miss its first World Cup since 1986. But there was Bradley, the captain of the team, dutifully talking to the press about the worst failure in American soccer history.

?It was a perfect storm kind of night where everything that possibly could have went wrong did in this stadium and in two other stadiums across the region,? he said.

It shouldn?t have ended this way. The Red, White, and Blue should be on their way to Russia, even after a World Cup qualification campaign that featured more lows than highs. They started off the Hexagonal round with two losses, and then replaced Jurgen Klinsmann with Bruce Arena, who quickly righted the campaign with eight points over the next four qualifiers. Christian Pulisic, who would end up figuring in 12 of the Americans? 17 goals scored in the final round of qualification, emerged as the team?s best player. (And it?s not particularly close, which is a problem.) A loss to Costa Rica at home and a last-second draw away to Honduras meant that the Americans needed points in their final two matches, but if they took care of business, they?d still nab a spot in next summer?s tournament.

After the first of those fixtures, they were all but booking their plane tickets, thanks to a dominating performance against Panama at home last Friday. When Pulisic scored in just the eighth minute, the tension in Orlando City Stadium dissipated and the rout was on, eventually ending 4-0. The initial tally came via Route 1: a goal kick, a flicked-on header, a cute pass by Jozy Altidore, and a hell of an individual effort from the teenager. At least one site called it ?Messi-like,? which is absurd (maybeeeee you could talk me into ?Messi-lite?), but there?s no one else on the team who could replicate that run?s combination of technique, pace, and calm finishing. It was simultaneously brilliant and predictable, showing just how far Pulisic has come in the last year. He would have dictated how successful the U.S. was in Russia.

Oh well. Only needing a draw against the worst team in the Hexagonal, the Americans failed spectacularly. Arena started the same group that featured in the victory four days earlier, and they looked lethargic from the opening whistle. ?Our energy level wasn?t there in the first half,? said center back Omar Gonz lez, whose failed clearance ended up in the back of the American net for the opener. ?You know, we couldn?t get close to them in the midfield. We couldn?t hold balls up top. Then unfortunately the ball that I put in. ? The list goes on. We just weren?t sharp enough.?

Arena had similar thoughts.

?Our center backs were not confident enough with the ball,? the manager who led the U.S. to the quarterfinal in 2002 said. ?Often in the first half we were playing eight against 10. They needed to carry the ball and bring a player to the ball and move a little bit quicker. Our forwards were not able to hold the ball. We weren?t able to get Pulisic into the game.?

The teenager did almost manage to save the U.S. once again, scoring on an individual effort just after halftime, but the Americans couldn't find an equalizer. Across CONCACAF, results turned against them: Honduras went ahead against Mexico and Panama defeated Costa Rica, thanks to a goal that shouldn?t have counted. But it did, Panama had its World Cup spot locked up, Honduras will play Australia for another slot, and the U.S., well, the U.S. needs to take a long-ass look in the mirror.

Not qualifying is a disaster, full stop, which is not the same thing as saying the program needs to be blown up. There?s talent in the youth ranks?if you want to feel better about the American program, watch the ongoing U-17s at the World Cup?and the development systems are starting to work. ?You don?t make wholesale changes based on the ball being two inches wide or two inches in,? U.S. Soccer Federation president Sunil Gulati said after the defeat, referring to Clint Dempsey?s late strike that struck the post. ?We will look at everything, obviously. All of our programs. Both the national teams and all the development stuff. But we have a lot of pieces in place that we think are very good and coming along.? These are the words of a disappointed man who oversaw a massive failure (and is perhaps trying to save his job), yes, but that doesn?t make them untrue.

The truth is that this was always a flawed team, one that would have qualified due to the ease of the CONCACAF region, then undergone a significant makeover in the eight months before the tournament. ?If we had qualified for the World Cup, there needed to be a number of changes for a World Cup roster,? Arena said during a postmatch press conference, which will likely be his last as the American manager. ?We have some young, promising players that would have made a bid to be part of the World Cup in 2018.?

While those players won?t get to make a play for the Russia roster, they will get a chance to become part of the senior team as soon as possible. There?s nothing to do now except prepare for 2022. The most intriguing prospect is 19-year-old Weston McKennie, currently starting for Schalke in the Bundesliga. A product of the FC Dallas Academy, the pit bull defensive midfielder could be the answer to the perpetual question of who pairs with Michael Bradley in the center of the field for the near future and who supplants the 30-year-old on a slightly longer timeline.

Then there?s Jonathan Gonzalez, another teenage center midfielder who?s emerged out of nowhere to play a starring role at Monterrey, the best team in Mexico?s Liga MX. The 18-year-old from Santa Rosa, California, spent time with the U.S. U-17, U-18, and U-20 squads and got a phone call from Arena earlier this year. He?s a bit more of a connector than McKennie, but one who?s also willing to make a tackle when necessary. ?I like to get the ball at my feet,? he said. ?I?m a distributor, I attack and defend, but I?m mostly playing out of the back, being the spine of the team.? While there?s a chance Mexico will try to recruit Gonzalez, he sounds committed to the United States (though the result could have changed that calculus).

Further down the pipeline is Tyler Adams. The New York Red Bull star is only 18 and still commuting 75 miles each way from his childhood home for training every day, but anyone who can play a seeing-eye through ball deserves a look. The fact that he can fill in at fullback adds to the potential allure. He will, at the very least, get a call into the U.S.?s January camp. His future is bright.

Those are just three players, and there are at least a half dozen more who could emerge over the next 12 months. Defenders including Tottenham?s Cameron Carter-Vickers (currently on loan at Sheffield United) and recent Manchester City signing Erik Palmer-Brown aren?t far away. Others who played only a small role over the past two years should get a shot?guys like Seattle?s Cristian Roldan and New England?s Kelyn Rowe. Josh Sargent, currently starring at the U-17 World Cup after winning the Silver Boot at the U-20 tournament earlier this year, will get a senior-team call sooner rather than later, especially if he shines at Werder Bremen when he officially moves next year.

Exactly how much change to make will be up to the next coach, whomever that may be. (U.S. youth technical director Tab Ramos? Sporting Kansas City?s Peter Vermes? Oscar Pareja from FC Dallas?) They?ll get time and space in what is an excellent job in world football. There?s clay to mold. The worst thing to do would be to start shaping it too quickly.

Plus, there?s still Pulisic. He?ll miss out on his first chance for a World Cup, which is a shame for anyone who cares about soccer. He?s electric and only improving, capable of doing so many things his teammates can't accomplish.

He needs help, however, as the Americans struggled all tournament against bunkered-in squads, which cost them in Trinidad and elsewhere. ?Teams have showed that they are going to sit back and frustrate us,? said Tim Howard, perhaps playing in his final World Cup qualifier. ?We?re going to need to break some teams down. Until we do that, teams won?t come out of their shell.?

T&T stayed in its shell, stayed in position, and walked away with an upset. The Americans, who came in on a high, walked away with nothing.

?This game, in my view, was perfectly positioned for the U.S. team,? Arena said. ?We failed on the day.?

?Anger. Frustration. Those are both good places to start,? said Bradley when asked about his emotions following the defeat. ?Quite honestly, you?re on empty. You give so much through this whole qualifying campaign to try to navigate every part of it. ... We have a group that?s able to pull strong and pull tight in big moments. And every single guy did that. When you get to the end, and it ends like this, you?re empty.?

Moments later, he walked off, carrying two pairs of cleats in plastic bags. One pair still had grass and dirt from the field in the metal spikes. The other looked brand new.

https://www.fastcompany.com/90244574/how-to-stop-wasting-your-life-watching-tv-do-something-worthwhile-with-your-downtime,y,"You get home from work, eat dinner, clean up, flop on the couch, and doze off watching TV or mess with your phone. Then you repeat the same routine Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Before you know it, you?ve hit the weekend, and it felt like all you did all week was work.

In reality, you had an hour or two to do whatever you wanted each night. But because you didn?t consciously invest that time in meaningful or satisfying activities, every day felt like a grind.

So how do you shake up this routine and begin to invest your time in activities that truly satisfy and refresh you?

As a time management coach, I?ve seen that these five strategies can help you feel like you have more free time and feel happier with how you invest it.

Plan your downtime in advance
Making a positive choice on what to do in the evening is really difficult when you already feel drained. A better option is to think ahead about your free time. That could include scheduling a dinner out, time to cook, a visit to the gym, or an opportunity to review your retirement accounts. If you?ll need to coordinate with others, I recommend scheduling events at least a few days in advance, for example, reaching out on Wednesday or Thursday for weekend plans. You may even want to put a recurring reminder in your calendar on Wednesdays to prompt you to think about the weekend. And for solo activities, such as reading or getting something done around your home, some conscious thinking even the morning of can better your chances of a good evening. For instance, on your way to work, you may decide that tonight you?ll go on a hike or finally tackle some outstanding bills.

Prep for action
Since free time is so limited, it?s essential that you prep in advance to take full advantage of your time. That could mean packing a gym bag so you can go straight from work to the gym, writing up a list of errands to run so that you can zip out at the end of the day and get right to them, or setting out what you?ll need to work on a home project later that evening. Teeing yourself up the night before lowers the chances of inaction and also incentivizes you to leave work on time. When you have a higher level of consciousness, you are aware that extra time in the office means less time for whatever else you want to do, so you have motivation to leave.

Do what satisfies
Not all activities will equally benefit your life. Watching TV or scrolling on your phone isn?t intrinsically bad or wrong, but these activities won?t produce the mood-enhancing brain chemicals that the most effective stress-relief strategies can. The best activities include exercising or playing sports, attending a religious service, reading, listening to music, spending time with friends or family, getting a massage, going for a walk, meditating, yoga, or hobbies.

Each person has slightly different preferences, so make a list of the specific activities that make you most happy. For example, if you?re extroverted, that might include getting out and around people as much as possible, whereas an introvert might need more solo activities. Then try to get some of them in each week. Maybe your list includes playing soccer, going on walks, reading, and spending time with your significant other. Clarity on what you want to do makes it easier to make those activities a priority.

Double the benefit
A simple way to multiply the benefit of your precious free time is to layer activities. For example, go on a walk with a friend, or work on a creative hobby with your significant other?either doing the same activity or being in the same room. One thing I discovered about myself in the last few years is that I would rather meet socially for a hike than drinks or dinner. So now, when friends suggest getting together, I try to steer us toward an outdoor activity. That way I get in social time and do something that refreshes me on a deep level.

Increase your sense of time
Another little trick to give yourself the sense that you have more free time is to do more than one activity in an evening. For example, instead of just working out, also take 10-15 minutes to read, or instead of just going out for dinner, also sort the mail. I don?t recommend packing your free time too tightly. But by doing multiple activities in one evening, it makes you feel like you experienced more within the same amount of time.

Can you watch TV at night? Absolutely. I?m not suggesting that you must ban yourself from all electronic devices in the evening. But you should consider a more intentional approach to your free time. Some small tweaks to how you spend it can make a huge impact to the sense that you have free time, your overall energy levels, and your satisfaction with life in general."
https://fs.blog/2012/10/velocity-of-skill-development/,n,"Brazil figured out how to rapidly increase the velocity of skill development in its football players and it?s not what you think.

Not all skills are developed in the same way ? developing soft-skills is different than developing hard skills.

It?s impossible to directly teach someone to improvise their way to a brilliant goal in hockey or soccer. The world does not work that way.

Part of the problem is time-based.

It?s hard to get the quantity of repetitions you need for feedback with the variety of situations you need to develop improvisation.

Traditionally coaches practice the most common situations. You can?t practice every possible scenario that you might face in a game because time is limited. So it makes sense that coaches focus on the most common situations that a player will face. Players get feedback from coaches on these situations and generally get better. The pace of these practices means that players will only get feedback on their decisions in a limited number of situations.

There is another way.You can tinker with the environment to force people to make faster decisions, increase the number of repetitions, and force a velocity that increases the variety or situations a player can practice.

This is what Brazil does differently.

In The Little Book of Talent, Daniel Coyle writes:

Soft skills are built by playing and exploring inside challenging, ever-changing environments.

Brazil is the home of many of the world?s most skilled soccer players. So you might wonder how it develops its players? They use a game called futebol de sal?o:

This insanely fast, tightly compressed five-on-five version of the game? played on a field the size of a basketball court? creates 600 percent more touches, demands instant pattern recognition and, in the words of Emilio Miranda, a professor of soccer at the University of S?o Paulo, serves as Brazil?s ?laboratory of improvisation.?

Lionel Messi, an Argentine football star, can?t plan where everyone on the field will be and how they will all react ? he has to improvise by recognising patterns and responding.

When developing a soft skill you want three things: 1) variety; 2) reps; and 3) feedback.

Futebol de sal?o is designed to encourage skill development.
